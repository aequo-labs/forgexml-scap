   <xccdf:notice id="terms-of-use" xml:lang="en">	BACKGROUND.
	The Center for Internet Security ("CIS") provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to Internet users worldwide.	Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally generic in nature.	The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and devices.	Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to specific user requirements.	The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick fix" for anyone's information security needs.
	NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS.
	CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of	the Products or the Recommendations.	CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is" and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind.	USER AGREEMENTS.
	By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We") agree and acknowledge that:
	1.	No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component can be made fully secure;
	2.	We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our own risk;
	3.	We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from 		CIS's negligence or failure to perform; 
	4.	We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the 			Recommendations to our particular circumstances and requirements;
	5.	Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below) has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify us of 		the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and
	6.	Neither CIS nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise) for 		any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or damage 		to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, 	business interruption, wasted management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties) arising out of or in any way 	Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such 	damages), including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, 	viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other harmful items.
	GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS.
	CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use:
	1.	Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and 	use each of the Products on a single computer;
	2.	Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided 		that all such copies are printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed Terms of Use in its entirety.
	RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTION.
	The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and by international treaties.	We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties.	CIS reserves all rights not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights."
	Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute, encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device, without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi) use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product.	We will not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed in this paragraph.
	We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers, directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates, licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim.	We further agree that all CIS Parties are third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use.	SPECIAL RULES.
	CIS has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship.	Those special rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are covered by the special rules.
	CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization, whether by manual or electronic means.	Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time.
	CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION; VENUE.
	We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.	If any of these Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
	BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN ALL RESPECTS.</xccdf:notice>

            <xhtml:p>The CIS Apache Benchmark recommends using the Apache binary provided by your vendor for most situations in order to reduce the effort and increase the effectiveness of maintenance and security patches. However, to keep the benchmark as generic and applicable to all Unix/Linux platforms as possible, a default source build has been used for this benchmark.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:strong>Important Note</xhtml:strong>
: There is a major difference between source builds and most vendor packages that is very important to highlight. The default source build of Apache is fairly conservative and minimalist in the modules included and therefore starts off in a fairly strong security state, while most vendor binaries are typically very well loaded with most of the functionality that one may be looking for.           <xhtml:em>
                  <xhtml:strong>Therefore, it is important that you don't assume the default value shown in the benchmark will match default values in your installation.</xhtml:strong>
               </xhtml:em>
 You should always test any new installation in your environment before putting it into production. Also keep in mind you can install and run a new version alongside the old one by using a different Apache prefix and a different IP address or port number in the           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Listen</xhtml:span>
 directive.        </xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>Neither HTTP Basic nor HTTP Digest authentication should be used as the protocols are out dated and no longer considered secure.  Disabling the modules will improve the security posture of the web server by reducing the amount of potentially vulnerable code paths exposed to the network and reducing potential for unauthorized access to files via misconfigured access controls.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>In the early days of the web, Basic HTTP Authentication was considered adequate if it was only used over HTTPS, so that the credentials would not be sent in the clear. Basic authentication uses Base64 to encode the credentials which are sent with every request. Base64 encoding is of course easily reversed, and is no more secure than clear text. The issues with using Basic Auth over HTTPS is that it does not meet current security standards for protecting the login credentials and protecting the authenticated
session. The following security issues plague the Basic Authentication protocol.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>

                  <xhtml:p>Application logout is required to invalidate the session on the server to limit, but in the case of Basic Authentication, there is no server-side session that can be invalidated.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:p>The credentials are remembered by the browser and stored in memory.</xhtml:p>

One of the best ways to reduce your exposure to attack when running a web server is to create a unique, unprivileged user and group for the server application. The           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">nobody</xhtml:span>
 or           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">daemon</xhtml:span>
 user and group that comes default on Unix variants should NOT be used to run the web server, since the account is commonly used for other separate daemon services. Instead, an account used only by the apache software so as to not give unnecessary access to other services. Also, the identifier used for the apache user should be a unique system account. System user accounts UID numbers have lower values which are reserved for the special system accounts not used by regular users, such as discussed in User Accounts section of the CIS Red Hat benchmark. Typically, system accounts numbers range from           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">1-999</xhtml:span>
, or           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">1-499</xhtml:span>
 and are defined in the           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/login.defs</xhtml:span>
 file.        </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>
As an even more secure alternative, if the Apache web server can be run on high unprivileged ports, then it is not necessary to start Apache as           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root</xhtml:span>
, and all of the Apache processes may be run as the Apache specific user as described below.        </xhtml:p>

On most Linux platforms, shared memory will be used instead of a file in the file system, so this directive is not generally needed and does not need to be specified.

            <xhtml:p>The following provides the rationale for each requirement on the application writable directory:</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:strong>Single Purpose Directory</xhtml:strong>
 - Each writable application directory should have a single purpose.  For example, mixing file uploads in the same directory with session tracking information would be an obvious vulnerability, as users could create session information, to hijack or manufacturer authenticated sessions.            </xhtml:p>
               </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:strong>Outside the Configured Web DocumentRoot</xhtml:strong>
 - The directory should NOT be under the configured DocumentRoot directory as such directories are browsable by default, and might allow unintentional web read access. With web read access an attacker could upload malicious content, and then references the content in a URL exploiting the trust that users have in the website.            </xhtml:p>
               </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:strong>Owned by the root User or an Administrator Account</xhtml:strong>
 – The directory should be owned by root or a designated administrator to prevent unintended changes to the permissions.            </xhtml:p>
               </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:strong>Not Writable by Other</xhtml:strong>
 -  The write access can be provided through the group permissions to the configured Apache group rather than allow write access to Other / all users.  The group write access should implement the least privileges necessary in order prevent unintended access to the directory. If the application requires more complex write access, such as to specific accounts or for multiple groups, usage of an access control lists (ACL) is recommended. ACL’s are supported by most Linux file systems, and can be enabled when the file system is mounted.            </xhtml:p>

The Apache           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Directory</xhtml:span>
 directive allows for directory specific configuration of access controls and many other features and options. One important usage is to create a default deny policy that does not allow access to operating system directories and files, except for those specifically allowed. This is done by denying access to the OS root directory.        </xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>One aspect of Apache, which is occasionally misunderstood, is the feature of default access. That is, unless you take steps to change it, if the server can find its way to a file through normal URL mapping rules, it can and will serve it to clients. Having a default deny is a predominate security principle, and then helps prevent the unintended access, and we do that in this case by denying access to the OS root directory using either of two methods but not both:</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ol>
               <xhtml:li>
Using the Apache             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Deny</xhtml:span>
 directive along with an             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Order</xhtml:span>
 directive.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
Using the Apache             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Require</xhtml:span>
 directive.          </xhtml:li>
            </xhtml:ol>
            <xhtml:p>
Either method is effective. The           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Order/Deny/Allow</xhtml:span>
 combination are now deprecated; they provide three passes where all the directives are processed in the specified order. In contrast, the           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Require</xhtml:span>
 directive works on the first match similar to firewall rules. The           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Require</xhtml:span>
 directive is the default for Apache 2.4 and is demonstrated in the remediation procedure as it may be less likely to be misunderstood.        </xhtml:p>

Likewise, the options for other directories and hosts needs to be restricted to the minimal options required. A setting of           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">None</xhtml:span>
 is recommended, however it is recognized that other options may be needed in some cases:        </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Multiviews</xhtml:span>
 - Is appropriate if content negotiation is required, such as when multiple languages are supported.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ExecCGI</xhtml:span>
 - Is only appropriate for special directories dedicated to executable content such as a             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">cgi-bin/</xhtml:span>
 directory. That way you will know what is executed on the server. It is possible to enable CGI script execution based on file extension or permission settings, however this makes script control and management almost impossible as developers may install scripts without your knowledge. This may become a factor in a hosting environment.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:span class="inline_block">FollowSymLinks</xhtml:span>
 &amp;             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">SymLinksIfOwnerMatch</xhtml:span>
 - The following of symbolic links is not recommended and should be disabled if possible. The usage of symbolic links opens up additional risk for possible attacks that may use inappropriate symbolic links to access content outside of the document root of the web server. Also consider that it could be combined with a vulnerability that allowed an attacker or insider to create an inappropriate link. The option             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">SymLinksIfOwnerMatch</xhtml:span>
 is much safer in that the ownership must match in order for the link to be used, however keep in mind there is additional overhead created by requiring Apache to check the ownership.          </xhtml:li>

 &amp;             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">IncludesNOEXEC</xhtml:span>
 - The             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">IncludesNOEXEC</xhtml:span>
 option should only be needed when server side includes are required. The full             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Includes</xhtml:span>
 option should not be used as it also allows execution of arbitrary shell commands. See Apache Mod Include for details             <xhtml:a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_include.html">https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_include.html</xhtml:a>

 - The             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Indexes</xhtml:span>
 option causes automatic generation of indexes, if the default index page is missing, and should be disabled unless required.          </xhtml:li>

CGI programs have a long history of security bugs and problems associated with improperly accepting user-input. Since these programs are often targets of attackers, we need to make sure that there are no unnecessary CGI programs that could potentially be used for malicious purposes. Usually these programs are not written for production use and consequently little thought was given to security in their development.

The HTTP 1.1 protocol supports several request methods which are rarely used and potentially high risk. For example, methods such as           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">PUT</xhtml:span>
 and           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">DELETE</xhtml:span>
 are rarely used and should be disabled in keeping with the primary security principal of minimize features and options. Also since the usage of these methods is typically to modify resources on the web server, they should be explicitly disallowed. For normal web server operation, you will typically need to allow only the           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">GET</xhtml:span>
,           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">HEAD</xhtml:span>
 and           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">POST</xhtml:span>
 request methods. This will allow for downloading of web pages and submitting information to web forms. The           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">OPTIONS</xhtml:span>
 request method will also be allowed as it used to request which HTTP request methods are allowed. Unfortunately, the Apache           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">&lt;LimitExcept&gt;</xhtml:span>
 directive does not deny the           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">TRACE</xhtml:span>
 request method. The           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">TRACE</xhtml:span>
 request method will be disallowed in another benchmark recommendation with the           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">TraceEnable</xhtml:span>

There are many files that are often left within the web server document root that could provide an attacker with sensitive information. Most often these files are mistakenly left behind after installation, trouble-shooting, or backing up files before editing. Regardless of the reason for their creation, these files can still be served by Apache even when there is no hyperlink pointing to them. The web administrators should use the           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">FilesMatch</xhtml:span>

            <xhtml:p>Using iframes and regular web frames to embed malicious content along with expected web content has been a favored attack vector for attacking web clients for a long time. This can happen when the attacker lures the victim to a malicious web site, which uses frames to include the expected content from the legitimate site. The attack can also be performed via XSS (either reflected, DOM or stored XSS) to add the malicious content to the legitimate web site.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>
To combat this attack vector, either an           <xhtml:em>X-Frame-Options</xhtml:em>

 response header may be used. The           <xhtml:em>Content-Security-Policy</xhtml:em>
  header is the preferred solution.
The           <xhtml:em>X-Frame-Options</xhtml:em>
 header should have a value of either           <xhtml:em>DENY</xhtml:em>
, which prevents all framing, or           <xhtml:em>SAMEORIGIN</xhtml:em>
 which prevents framing except via pages which share the same origin. The           <xhtml:em>Content-Security-Policy</xhtml:em>

 errors may be an indication that an attack is pending or has occurred. Starting with Apache 2.4 the error log does not include the           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">not found</xhtml:span>
 errors except at the           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">info</xhtml:span>
 logging level. Therefore, it is important that the log level be set to           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">info</xhtml:span>
 for the           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">core</xhtml:span>
 module. The           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">not found</xhtml:span>

Keep in mind that the generation of logs is under a potential attacker's control. So, do not hold any Apache log files on the root partition of the OS. This could result in a denial of service against your web server host by filling up the root partition and causing the system to crash. For this reason, it is recommended that the log files should be stored on a dedicated partition. Likewise consider that attackers sometimes put information into your logs which is intended to attack your log collection or log analysis processing software. So, it is important that they are not vulnerable. Investigation of incidents often require access to several months or more of logs, which is why it is important to keep at least 3 months available. Two common log rotation utilities include           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rotatelogs(8)</xhtml:span>
 which is bundled with Apache, and           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">logrotate(8)</xhtml:span>

ModSecurity is an open source web application firewall (WAF) for real-time web application monitoring, logging, and access control. It enables but does not include a powerful customizable rule set, which may be used to detect and block common web application attacks. Installation of ModSecurity without a rule set does not provide additional security for the protected web applications. Refer to the benchmark recommendation "          <xhtml:em>Install and Enable OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set</xhtml:em>
" for details on a recommended rule set.        </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:strong>Note:</xhtml:strong>
 Like other application security/application firewall systems, ModSecurity requires a significant commitment of staff resources for initial tuning of the rules and handling alerts. In some cases, this may require additional time working with application developers/maintainers to modify applications based on analysis of the results of tuning and monitoring logs. After setup, an ongoing commitment of staff is required for monitoring logs and ongoing tuning, especially after upgrades/patches. Without this commitment to tuning and monitoring, installing ModSecurity may NOT be effective and may provide a false sense of security.        </xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:li>HTTP Protection - detecting violations of the HTTP protocol and a locally defined usage policy.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>Real-time Blacklist Lookups - utilizes 3rd Party IP Reputation</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>HTTP Denial of Service Protections - defense against HTTP Flooding and Slow HTTP DoS Attacks.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>Common Web Attacks Protection - detecting common web application security attack.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>Automation Detection - detecting bots, crawlers, scanners and other surface malicious activity.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>Integration with AV Scanning for File Uploads - detects malicious files uploaded through the web application.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>Tracking Sensitive Data - tracks credit card usage and blocks leakages.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>Trojan Protection - detecting access to trojan horses.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>Identification of Application Defects - alerts on application misconfigurations.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>Error Detection and Hiding - disguising error messages sent by the server.</xhtml:li>
            </xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:strong>Note:</xhtml:strong>
 Like other application security/application firewall systems, ModSecurity requires a significant commitment of staff resources for initial tuning of the rules and handling alerts. In some cases, this may require additional time working with application developers/maintainers to modify applications based on analysis of the results of tuning and monitoring logs. After setup, an ongoing commitment of staff is required for monitoring logs and ongoing tuning, especially after upgrades/patches. Without this commitment to tuning and monitoring, installing ModSecurity may NOT be effective and may provide a false sense of security.        </xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) was developed by Netscape and turned into an open standard and was renamed Transport Layer Security (TLS) as part of the process. TLS is important for protecting communication and can provide authentication of the server and even the client. However, contrary to vendor claims, implementing SSL does NOT directly make your web server more secure! SSL is used to encrypt traffic and therefore does provide confidentiality of private information and users credentials. Keep in mind, however that just because you have encrypted the data in transit does not mean that the data provided by the client is secure while it is on the server. Also, SSL does not protect the web server, as attackers will easily target SSL-Enabled web servers, and the attack will be hidden in the encrypted channel.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>
The           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">mod_ssl</xhtml:span>
 module is the standard, most used module that implements SSL/TLS for Apache. A newer module found on Red Hat systems can be a compliment or replacement for           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">mod_ssl</xhtml:span>
 and provides the same functionality plus additional security services. The           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">mod_nss</xhtml:span>
 is an Apache module implementation of the Network Security Services (NSS) software from Mozilla, which implements a wide range of cryptographic functions in addition to TLS.        </xhtml:p>

Decide on the host name to be used for the certificate. It is important to remember that the browser will compare the host name in the URL to the common name in the certificate, so that it is important that all https: URL's match the correct host name. Specifically, the host name                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">www.example.com</xhtml:span>
 is not the same as                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">example.com</xhtml:span>

Generate a private key using openssl. Although certificate key lengths of 1024 have been common in the past, a key length of 2048 is now recommended for strong authentication. The key must be kept confidential and will be encrypted with a passphrase by default. Follow the steps below and respond to the prompts for a passphrase.

Create a certificate specific template configuration file. It is important that common name in the certificate exactly make the web host name in the intended URL. If there are multiple host names which may be used, as is very common, then the                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">subjectAltName</xhtml:span>
 (SAN) field should be filled with all of the alternate names.  Creating a template configuration file specific to the server certificate is helpful, as it allows for multiple entries in the                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">subjectAltName</xhtml:span>
.  Also, any typos in the CSR can be potentially costly due to the lost time, so using a file, rather than hand typing helps prevent errors.  To create a template configuration file, make a local copy of the                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">openssl.cnf</xhtml:span>
 typically found in                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/ssl/</xhtml:span>
 or                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/pki/tls/</xhtml:span>
                        <xhtml:code class="code_block"># cp /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf ex1.cnf
</xhtml:code>
                     </xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
Find the request section which follows the line “                <xhtml:span class="inline_block">[ req ] </xhtml:span>
".  Then add or modify the configuration file to include the appropriate values for the host names. It is recommended (but not required) that the first                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">subjectAltName</xhtml:span>
 match the                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">commonName</xhtml:span>
.
                <xhtml:code class="code_block">[ req ]

                     <xhtml:li>
Continue editing the configuration file under the request distinguished name section to change the existing default values in the configuration file to match the desired certificates information.

                     <xhtml:li>
The resulting signed certificate may be named                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">www.example.com.crt</xhtml:span>

 as readable by all (mode                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">0444</xhtml:span>
). Please note that the certificate authority does not need the private key (                <xhtml:span class="inline_block">example.com.key</xhtml:span>
) and this file must be carefully protected. With a decrypted copy of the private key, it would be possible to decrypt all conversations with the server.              </xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
Do not forget the passphrase used to encrypt the private key. It will be required every time the server is started in https mode. If it is necessary to avoid requiring an administrator having to type the passphrase every time the                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">httpd</xhtml:span>
 service is started, the private key may be stored in clear text. Storing the private key in clear text increases the convenience while increasing the risk of disclosure of the key, but may be appropriate for the sake of being able to restart, if the risks are well managed. Be sure that the key file is only readable by root. To decrypt the private key and store it in clear text file the following openssl command may be used. You can tell by the private key headers whether it is encrypted or clear text.
                <xhtml:code class="code_block"># cd /etc/ssl/private/
# umask 077

Locate the Apache configuration file for                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">mod_ssl</xhtml:span>

 and                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">SSLCertificateKeyFile</xhtml:span>
directives to have the correct path for the private key and signed certificate files. If a clear text key is referenced then a passphrase will not be required. You may need to configure the CA's certificate along with any intermediate CA certificates that signed your certificate using the                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">SSLCertificateChainFile</xhtml:span>
 directive. As an alternative, starting with Apache version 2.4.8 the CA and intermediate certificates may be concatenated to the server certificate configured with the                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">SSLCertificateFile</xhtml:span>
 directive instead.

         <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
            <xhtml:p>It is critical to protect the server's private key. The server's private key is encrypted by default as a means of protecting it. However, having it encrypted means that the passphrase is required each time the server is started up, and now it is necessary to protect the passphrase as well. The passphrase may be typed in when it is manually started up or provided by an automated program.
To summarize, the options are:</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ol>
               <xhtml:li>
Use             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">SSLPassPhraseDialog builtin</xhtml:span>
, - requires a passphrase to be manually entered.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
Use             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">SSLPassPhraseDialog |/path/to/program</xhtml:span>
 to provide the passphrase.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
Use             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">SSLPassPhraseDialog exec:/path/to/program</xhtml:span>
 to provide the passphrase,          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>Store the private key in clear text so that a passphrase is not required.</xhtml:li>
            </xhtml:ol>
            <xhtml:p>Any of the above options 1-4 are acceptable as long as the key and passphrase are protected as described below. Option 1 has the additional security benefit of not storing the passphrase, but is not generally acceptable for most production web servers, since it requires the web server to be manually started. Options 2 and 3 can provide additional security if the programs providing them are secure. Option 4 is the simplest, is widely used and is acceptable as long as the private key is appropriately protected.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>
The SSL/TLS protocols support a large number of encryption ciphers including many weak ciphers that are subject to man-in-the middle attacks and information disclosure. Some implementations even support the NULL cipher which allows a TLS connection without any encryption! Therefore, it is critical to ensure the configuration only allows strong ciphers greater than or equal to 128-bit to be negotiated with the client. Stronger 256-bit ciphers should be allowed and preferred. In addition, enabling the           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">SSLHonorCipherOrder</xhtml:span>
 further protects the client from man-in-the-middle downgrade attacks by ensuring the server's preferred ciphers will be used rather than the clients' preferences.        </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>In addition, the RC4 stream ciphers should be disabled, even though they are widely used and have been recommended in previous Apache benchmarks as a means of mitigating attacks based on CBC cipher vulnerabilities. The RC4 ciphers have known cryptographic weaknesses and are no longer recommended. The IETF has published RFC 7465 standard [2] that would disallow RC4 negotiation for all TLS versions. While the document is somewhat new (Feb 2015) it is expected the RC4 cipher suites will begin to disappear from options in TLS deployments. In the meantime, it is important to ensure that RC4-based cipher suites are disabled in the configuration.</xhtml:p>

A man-in-the-middle renegotiation attack was discovered in SSLv3 and TLSv1 in November, 2009 (          <xhtml:a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2009-3555">CVE-2009-3555</xhtml:a>
). First, a work around and then a fix was approved as an Internet Standard as RFC 574, Feb 2010. The work around, which removes the renegotiation, is available from OpenSSL as of version 0.9.8l and newer versions. For details:           <xhtml:a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20091111.txt">https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20091111.txt</xhtml:a>

The           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">SSLInsecureRenegotiation</xhtml:span>

            <xhtml:p>The OCSP protocol is a big improvement over CRLs (certificate revocation lists) for checking if a certificate has been revoked. There are however some minor privacy and efficiency concerns with OCSP. The fact that the browser has to check a third-party CA discloses that the browser is configured for OCSP checking. Also, the already high overhead of making an SSL connection is increased by the need for the OCSP requests and responses. The OCSP stapling improves the situation by having the SSL server "staple" an OCSP response, signed by the OCSP server, to the certificate it presents to the client. This obviates the need for the client to ask the OCSP server for status information on the server certificate. However, the client will still need to make OCSP requests on any intermediate CA certificates that are typically used to sign the server's certificate.</xhtml:p>

Usage of HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) helps protect HSTS compliant browsers and other agents from HTTP downgrade attacks. Downgrade attacks include a variety of man-in-the-middle attacks which leave the web communication vulnerable to disclosure and modification by forcing the usage of HTTP rather than HTTPS communication. The           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">sslstrip</xhtml:span>
 attack tool by Moxie Marlinspike released in 2009 is one such attack, which works when the server allows both HTTP and HTTPS communication. However, a man-in-the-middle HTTP-to-HTTPS proxy would be effective in cases where the server required HTTPS, but did not publish an HSTS policy to the browser. This attack would also be effective on browsers which were not compliant with HSTS. All current up-to-date browsers support HSTS.        </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>The HSTS header specifies a length of time in seconds that the browser/user agent should access the server only using HTTPS. The header may also specify if all sub-domains should also be included in the same policy. Once a compliant browser receives the HSTS Header it will not allow access to the server via HTTP. Therefore, it is important that you ensure that there is no portion of the web site or web application that requires HTTP prior to enabling the HSTS protocol.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>
If all sub-domains are to be included via the           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">includeSubDomains</xhtml:span>
 option, then carefully consider all various host names, web applications and third-party services used to include any DNS CNAME values that may be impacted. An overly broad           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">includeSubDomains</xhtml:span>
 policy will disable access to HTTP web sites for all websites with the same domain name. Also consider that the access will be disabled for the number of seconds given in the max-age value, so in the event a mistake is made, a large value, such as a year, could create significant support issues. An optional flag of preload may be added if the web site name is to be submitted to be preloaded in Chrome, Firefox and Safari browsers.

During the TLS handshake, after the initial client &amp; server Hello, there is a pre-master secret generated, which is used to generate the master secret, and in turn generates the session key.  When using protocols that do not provide forward secrecy, such as RSA, the pre-master secret is encrypted by the client with the server's public key and sent over the network.   However, with protocols such as           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ECDHE</xhtml:span>
 (Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral) the pre-master secret is not sent over the wire, even in encrypted format. The key exchange arrives at the shared secret in the clear using ephemeral keys that are not stored or used again. With FS, each session has a unique key exchange, so that future sessions are protected.        </xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>Information is power and identifying web server details greatly increases the efficiency of any attack, as security vulnerabilities are extremely dependent upon specific software versions and configurations. Excessive probing and requests may cause too much "noise" being generated and may tip off an administrator. If an attacker can accurately target their exploits, the chances of successful compromise prior to detection increase dramatically. Script Kiddies are constantly scanning the Internet and documenting the version information openly provided by web servers. The purpose of this scanning is to accumulate a database of software installed on those hosts, which can then be used when new vulnerabilities are released.</xhtml:p>

Denial of Service (DoS) is an attack technique with the intent of preventing a web site from serving normal user activity. DoS attacks, which are normally applied to the network layer, are also possible at the application layer. These malicious attacks can succeed by starving a system of critical resources, vulnerability exploit, or abuse of functionality. Although there is no 100% solution for preventing DoS attacks, the following recommendation uses the           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Timeout</xhtml:span>

One common technique for DoS is to initiate many connections to the server. By decreasing the timeout for old connections and we allow the server to free up resources more quickly and be more responsive. By making the server more efficient, it will be more resilient to DoS conditions. The           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Timeout</xhtml:span>

Setting a request header timeout is vital for mitigating Denial of Service attacks based on slow requests. The slow request attacks are particularly lethal and relatively easy to perform, because they require very little bandwidth and can easily be done through anonymous proxies. Starting in June 2009 with the Slow Loris DoS attack, which used a slow           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">GET</xhtml:span>
 request as published by Robert Hansen (RSnake) on his blog           <xhtml:a href="http://ha.ckers.org/slowloris/">http://ha.ckers.org/slowloris/</xhtml:a>
. Later in November 2010 at the OWASP App Sec DC conference Wong Onn Chee demonstrated a slow           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">POST</xhtml:span>
 request attack which was even more effective. For details, see:           <xhtml:a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/H.....t.....t....p.......p....o....s....t">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/H.....t.....t....p.......p....o....s....t</xhtml:a>

The           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">RequestReadTimeout</xhtml:span>
 directive also allows setting timeout values for the body portion of a request. The directive provides for an initial timeout value, and a maximum timeout and minimum rate. The minimum rate specifies that after the initial timeout, the server will wait an additional 1 second for each N bytes received. The recommended setting is to have a maximum timeout of           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">20</xhtml:span>

Buffer Overflow attacks attempt to exploit an application by providing more data than the application buffer can contain. If the application allows copying data to the buffer to overflow the boundaries of the buffer, then the application is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The results of Buffer overflow vulnerabilities vary, and may result in the application crashing, or may allow the attacker to execute instructions provided in the data. The Apache           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">LimitRequest*</xhtml:span>

The limiting of the size of the request body is helpful so that the web server can prevent an unexpectedly long or large request from being passed to a potentially vulnerable program.

SELinux provides additional enforced security which will prevent access to resources, files and directories by the httpd processes even in cases where an application or server vulnerability might allow inappropriate access. The SELinux controls are advanced security controls that require significant effort to ensure they do not negatively impact the application and/or site functionality. It is highly recommended that the configuration states described in this section be tested thoroughly on test servers prior to deploying them to production servers.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>SELinux and AppArmor provide similar controls, and it is not recommended to use both SELinux and AppArmor on the same system. Depending on which Linux distribution is in use either AppArmor or SELinux are likely to be already installed or readily available as packages. AppArmor differs from SELinux in that it binds the controls to programs rather than users and uses path names rather than labeled type enforcement.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>SELinux includes customizable targeted policies that may be used to confine the Apache httpd server to enforce least privileges so that the httpd server has only the minimal access to specified directories, files and network ports. Access is controlled by process types (domains) defined for the httpd process. There are over a hundred individual httpd related types defined in a default Apache SELinux policy which includes many of the common Apache add-ons and applications such as php, nagios, smokeping and many others. The default SELinux policies work well for a default Apache installation, but implementation of SELinux targeted polices on a complex or highly customized web server requires a rather significant development and testing effort which comprehends both the workings of SELinux and the detailed operations and requirements of the web application.</xhtml:p>

With the proper implementation of SELinux, vulnerabilities in the web application may be prevented from being exploited due to the additional restrictions.

The AppArmor controls are advanced security controls that require significant effort to ensure they do not negatively impact the application and/or site functionality. It is highly recommended that the configuration states described in this section be tested thoroughly on test servers prior to deploying them to production servers.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>AppArmor and SELinux provide similar controls, and it is not recommended to use both SELinux and AppArmor on the same system. Depending on which Linux distribution is in use either AppArmor or SELinux are likely to be already installed or readily available as packages. AppArmor differs from SELinux in that it binds the controls to programs rather than users and uses path names rather than labeled type enforcement.</xhtml:p>

AppArmor includes customizable profiles that may be used to confine the Apache web server to enforce least privileges so that the server has only the minimal access to specified directories, files and network ports. Access is controlled by a profile defined for the apache2 process. The default AppArmor profile is typically a very permissive profile that allows read-write access to all system files. Therefore, it's important that the default profile be customized to enforce least privileges. The AppArmor utilities such as           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">aa-autodep</xhtml:span>
,           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">aa-complain</xhtml:span>
, and           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">aa-logprof</xhtml:span>
 can be used to generate an initial profile based on actual usage. However thorough testing, review and customization will be necessary to ensure that the Apache profile restrictions allow necessary functionality while implementing least privilege.        </xhtml:p>
