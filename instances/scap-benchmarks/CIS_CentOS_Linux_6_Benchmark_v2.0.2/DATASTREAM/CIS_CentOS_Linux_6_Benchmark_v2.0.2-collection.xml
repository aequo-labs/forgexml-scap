               <xhtml:strong>This is the archive of the CIS CentOS Linux 6 Benchmark v2.0.2. CIS encourages you to migrate to a more recent, supported version of this technology.</xhtml:strong>
            </xhtml:h3>
            <xhtml:p>This document provides prescriptive guidance for establishing a secure configuration posture for CentOS Linux 6 systems running on x86 and x64 platforms. This document was tested against CentOS 6.7.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>The guidance within broadly assumes that operations are being performed as the root user. Non-root users may not be able to access certain areas of the system, especially after remediation has been performed. It is advisable to verify root users path integrity and the integrity of any programs being run prior to execution of commands and scripts included in this benchmark.</xhtml:p>

         <xccdf:notice id="terms-of-use" xml:lang="en">	BACKGROUND.
	The Center for Internet Security ("CIS") provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to Internet users worldwide.	Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally generic in nature.	The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and devices.	Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to specific user requirements.	The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick fix" for anyone's information security needs.
	NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS.
	CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of	the Products or the Recommendations.	CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is" and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind.	USER AGREEMENTS.
	By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We") agree and acknowledge that:
	1.	No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component can be made fully secure;
	2.	We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our own risk;
	3.	We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from 		CIS's negligence or failure to perform; 
	4.	We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the 			Recommendations to our particular circumstances and requirements;
	5.	Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below) has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify us of 		the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and
	6.	Neither CIS nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise) for 		any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or damage 		to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, 	business interruption, wasted management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties) arising out of or in any way 	Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such 	damages), including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, 	viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other harmful items.
	GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS.
	CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use:
	1.	Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and 	use each of the Products on a single computer;
	2.	Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided 		that all such copies are printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed Terms of Use in its entirety.
	RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTION.
	The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and by international treaties.	We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties.	CIS reserves all rights not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights."
	Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute, encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device, without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi) use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product.	We will not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed in this paragraph.
	We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers, directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates, licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim.	We further agree that all CIS Parties are third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use.	SPECIAL RULES.
	CIS has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship.	Those special rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are covered by the special rules.
	CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization, whether by manual or electronic means.	Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time.
	CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION; VENUE.
	We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.	If any of these Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
	BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN ALL RESPECTS.</xccdf:notice>

                  <xhtml:p>Directories that are used for system-wide functions can be further protected by placing them on separate partitions. This provides protection for resource exhaustion and enables the use of mounting options that are applicable to the directory's intended use. Users' data can be stored on separate partitions and have stricter mount options. A user partition is a filesystem that has been established for use by the users and does not contain software for system operations.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>The recommendations in this section are easier to perform during initial system installation. If the system is already installed, it is recommended that a full backup be performed before repartitioning the system.</xhtml:p>

 If you are repartitioning a system that has already been installed, make sure the data has been copied over to the new partition, unmount it and then remove the data from the directory that was in the old partition. Otherwise it will still consume space in the old partition that will be masked when the new filesystem is mounted. For example, if a system is in single-user mode with no filesystems mounted and the administrator adds a lot of data to the                                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>

                     <xhtml:p>A number of uncommon filesystem types are supported under Linux. Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the system. If a filesystem type is not needed it should be disabled. Native Linux file systems are designed to ensure that built-in security controls function as expected. Non-native filesystems can lead to unexpected consequences to both the security and functionality of the system and should be used with caution. Many filesystems are created for niche use cases and are not maintained and supported as the operating systems are updated and patched. Users of non-native filesystems should ensure that there is attention and ongoing support for them, especially in light of frequent operating system changes.</xhtml:p>

                     <xhtml:p>Recent processors in the x86 family support the ability to prevent code execution on a per memory page basis. Generically and on AMD processors, this ability is called No Execute (NX), while on Intel processors it is called Execute Disable (XD). This ability can help prevent exploitation of buffer overflow vulnerabilities and should be activated whenever possible. Extra steps must be taken to ensure that this protection is enabled, particularly on 32-bit x86 systems. Other processors, such as Itanium and POWER, have included such support since inception and the standard kernel for those platforms supports the feature.</xhtml:p>

SELinux provides a Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system that greatly augments the default Discretionary Access Control (DAC) model. Under SELinux, every process and every object (files, sockets, pipes) on the system is assigned a security context, a label that includes detailed type information about the object. The kernel allows processes to access objects only if that access is explicitly allowed by the policy in effect. The policy defines transitions, so that a user can be allowed to run software, but the software can run under a different context than the user's default. This automatically limits the damage that the software can do to files accessible by the calling user. The user does not need to take any action to gain this benefit. For an action to occur, both the traditional DAC permissions must be satisfied as well as the SELinux MAC rules. The action will not be allowed if either one of these models does not permit the action. In this way, SELinux rules can only make a system's permissions more restrictive and secure. SELinux requires a complex policy to allow all the actions required of a system under normal operation. Three such policies have been designed for use with RHEL7 and are included with the system:                                         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">targeted</xhtml:span>

, and                                         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">mls</xhtml:span>

: consists mostly of Type Enforcement (TE) rules, and a small number of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) rules. Targeted restricts the actions of many types of programs, but leaves interactive users largely unaffected.                                        </xhtml:li>

It is important that the organization's legal counsel review the content of all messages before any system modifications are made, as these warning messages are inherently site-specific.

Warning messages inform users who are attempting to login to the system of their legal status regarding the system and must include the name of the organization that owns the system and any monitoring policies that are in place. Displaying OS and patch level information in login banners also has the side effect of providing detailed system information to attackers attempting to target specific exploits of a system.

                     <xhtml:p>In networking, source routing allows a sender to partially or fully specify the route packets take through a network. In contrast, non-source routed packets travel a path determined by routers in the network. In some cases, systems may not be routable or reachable from some locations (e.g. private addresses vs. Internet routable), and so source routed packets would need to be used.</xhtml:p>

 to 0 disables the system from accepting source routed packets. Assume this system was capable of routing packets to Internet routable addresses on one interface and private addresses on another interface. Assume that the private addresses were not routable to the Internet routable addresses and vice versa. Under normal routing circumstances, an attacker from the Internet routable addresses could not use the system as a way to reach the private address systems. If, however, source routed packets were allowed, they could be used to gain access to the private address systems as the route could be specified, rather than rely on routing protocols that did not allow this routing.                                  </xhtml:p>

ICMP redirect messages are packets that convey routing information and tell your host (acting as a router) to send packets via an alternate path.

Configuration of a live systems firewall directly over a remote connection will often result in being locked out. It is advised to have a known good firewall configuration set to run on boot and to configure an entire firewall structure in a script that is then run and tested before saving to boot. The following script will implement the firewall rules of this section and open port 22(ssh) from anywhere:                            </xhtml:p>

            <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
               <xhtml:p>The items in this section describe how to configure logging, log monitoring, and auditing, using tools included in most distributions.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>


It is recommended that                             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rsyslog </xhtml:span>


be used for logging (with                             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">logwatch </xhtml:span>


providing summarization) and                             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">auditd</xhtml:span>


 be used for auditing (with                             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">aureport </xhtml:span>


providing summarization) to automatically monitor logs for intrusion attempts and other suspicious system behavior.                      </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>In addition to the local log files created by the steps in this section, it is also recommended that sites collect copies of their system logs on a secure, centralized log server via an encrypted connection. Not only does centralized logging help sites correlate events that may be occurring on multiple systems, but having a second copy of the system log information may be critical after a system compromise where the attacker has modified the local log files on the affected system(s). If a log correlation system is deployed, configure it to process the logs described in this section.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>


Because it is often necessary to correlate log information from many different systems (particularly after a security incident) it is recommended that the time be synchronized among systems and devices connected to the local network. The standard Internet protocol for time synchronization is the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which is supported by most network-ready devices. See the                             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ntpd(8)</xhtml:span>


 manual page for more information on configuring NTP.                      </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>It is important that all logs described in this section be monitored on a regular basis and correlated to determine trends. A seemingly innocuous entry in one log could be more significant when compared to an entry in another log.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:strong>Note on log file permissions:</xhtml:strong>


 There really isn't a "one size fits all" solution to the permissions on log files. Many sites utilize group permissions so that administrators who are in a defined security group, such as "wheel" do not have to elevate privileges to root in order to read log files. Also, if a third party log aggregation tool is used, it may need to have group permissions to read the log files, which is preferable to having it run setuid to root. Therefore, there are two remediation and audit steps for log file permissions. One is for systems that do not have a secured group method implemented that only permits root to read the log files (                            <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root:root 600</xhtml:span>


). The other is for sites that do have such a setup and are designated as                             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root:securegrp 640 </xhtml:span>


where                             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">securegrp </xhtml:span>


is the defined security group (in some cases                             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">wheel</xhtml:span>


).                      </xhtml:p>

System auditing, through                                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">auditd</xhtml:span>


, allows system administrators to monitor their systems such that they can detect unauthorized access or modification of data. By default, auditd will audit SELinux AVC denials, system logins, account modifications, and authentication events. Events will be logged to                                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log/audit/audit.log</xhtml:span>


. The recording of these events will use a modest amount of disk space on a system. If significantly more events are captured, additional on system or off system storage may need to be allocated.                            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>


The recommendations in this section implement an audit policy that produces large quantities of logged data. In some environments it can be challenging to store or process these logs and as such they are marked as Level 2 for both Servers and Workstations.                                   <xhtml:strong>Note:</xhtml:strong>


 For 64 bit systems that have arch as a rule parameter, you will need two rules: one for 64 bit and one for 32 bit systems. For 32 bit systems, only one rule is needed.                            </xhtml:p>

                     <xhtml:p>When auditing, it is important to carefully configure the storage requirements for audit logs.

It is possible on a system that the 20 MBs of audit logs may fill up the system causing loss of audit data. While the recommendations here provide guidance, check your site policy for audit storage requirements.</xhtml:p>

                     <xhtml:p>Based on research conducted at various institutions, it was determined that the symmetric portion of the SSH Transport Protocol (as described in RFC 4253) has security weaknesses that allowed recovery of up to 32 bits of plaintext from a block of ciphertext that was encrypted with the Cipher Block Chaining (CBD) method. From that research, new Counter mode algorithms (as described in RFC4344) were designed that are not vulnerable to these types of attacks and these algorithms are now recommended for standard use.</xhtml:p>

PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) is a service that implements modular authentication modules on UNIX systems. PAM is implemented as a set of shared objects that are loaded and executed when a program needs to authenticate a user. Files for PAM are typically located in the                                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/pam.d</xhtml:span>


 directory. PAM must be carefully configured to secure system authentication. While this section covers some of PAM, please consult other PAM resources to fully understand the configuration capabilities.                            </xhtml:p>

It is important to make sure that accounts that are not being used by regular users are prevented from being used to provide an interactive shell. By default, CentOS 6 sets the password field for these accounts to an invalid string, but it is also recommended that the shell field in the password file be set to                                         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/sbin/nologin</xhtml:span>
