         <xccdf:notice id="terms-of-use" xml:lang="en">	BACKGROUND.
	The Center for Internet Security ("CIS") provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to Internet users worldwide.	Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally generic in nature.	The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and devices.	Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to specific user requirements.	The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick fix" for anyone's information security needs.
	NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS.
	CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of	the Products or the Recommendations.	CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is" and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind.	USER AGREEMENTS.
	By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We") agree and acknowledge that:
	1.	No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component can be made fully secure;
	2.	We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our own risk;
	3.	We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from 		CIS's negligence or failure to perform; 
	4.	We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the 			Recommendations to our particular circumstances and requirements;
	5.	Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below) has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify us of 		the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and
	6.	Neither CIS nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise) for 		any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or damage 		to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, 	business interruption, wasted management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties) arising out of or in any way 	Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such 	damages), including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, 	viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other harmful items.
	GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS.
	CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use:
	1.	Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and 	use each of the Products on a single computer;
	2.	Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided 		that all such copies are printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed Terms of Use in its entirety.
	RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTION.
	The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and by international treaties.	We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties.	CIS reserves all rights not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights."
	Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute, encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device, without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi) use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product.	We will not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed in this paragraph.
	We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers, directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates, licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim.	We further agree that all CIS Parties are third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use.	SPECIAL RULES.
	CIS has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship.	Those special rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are covered by the special rules.
	CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization, whether by manual or electronic means.	Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time.
	CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION; VENUE.
	We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.	If any of these Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
	BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN ALL RESPECTS.</xccdf:notice>

The TCP small servers are:</xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>Echo: Echoes back whatever you type through the telnet x.x.x.x echo command.</xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>Chargen: Generates a stream of ASCII data. Use the telnet x.x.x.x chargen command.</xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>Discard: Throws away whatever you type. Use the telnet x.x.x.x discard command.</xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>Daytime: Returns system date and time, if it is correct. It is correct if you run Network Time Protocol (NTP), or have set the date and time manually from the exec level. Use the telnet x.x.x.x daytime command.</xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>Replace x.x.x.x with the IP address of your router. Most routers inside Cisco run the small servers.</xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>UDP Small Servers
The UDP small servers are:</xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>Echo: Echoes the payload of the datagram you send.</xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>Discard: Silently pitches the datagram you send.</xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>Chargen: Pitches the datagram you send, and responds with a 72-character string of ASCII characters terminated with a CR+LF.</xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>Notes:</xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>Almost all Unix boxes support the small servers listed above.</xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>The router also offers finger service and async line bootp service, which you can independently turn off with the configuration global commands no service finger and no ip bootp server, respectively.</xhtml:p>

                     <xhtml:p>Cisco routers can send their log messages to a Unix-style Syslog service. A syslog service simply accepts messages and stores them in files or prints them according to a simple configuration file. This form of logging is best because it can provide protected long-term storage for logs (the devices internal logging buffer has limited capacity to store events.) In addition, logging to an external system is highly recommended or required by most security standards. If desired or required by policy, law and/or regulation, enable a second syslog server for redundancy.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>The Management Plane Protection (MPP) feature provides the capability to restrict the interfaces on which network management packets are allowed to enter a device. The MPP feature allows a network operator to designate one or more router interfaces as management interfaces.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>The MPP protection feature, as well as all the management protocols under MPP, are disabled by default. When you configure an interface as either out-of-band or inband, it automatically enables MPP. Consequently, this enablement extends to all the protocols under MPP. If MPP is disabled and a protocol is activated, all interfaces can pass traffic.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>When MPP is enabled with an activated protocol, the only default management interfaces allowing management traffic are the route processor (RP) and standby route processor (SRP) Ethernet interfaces.

The keychain provides a secure mechanism to handle the keys and rollover based on the lifetime. Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), and Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) use the keychain to implement a hitless key rollover for authentication. BGP uses TCP authentication, which enables the authentication option and sends the Message Authentication Code (MAC) based on the cryptographic algorithm configured for the keychain.</xhtml:p>

                     <xhtml:p>NTP synchronizes timekeeping among a set of distributed time servers and clients. With this synchronization, you can correlate events to the time that system logs were created and the time that other time-specific events occur. An NTP server must be accessible by the client switch.</xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>NTP uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) as its transport protocol. All NTP communication uses Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which is the same as Greenwich Mean Time. An NTP network usually gets its time from an authoritative time source, such as a radio clock or an atomic clock that is attached to a time server. NTP distributes this time across the network. NTP is extremely efficient; no more than one packet per minute is necessary to synchronize two machines to within a millisecond of one another.</xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>NTP uses a stratum to describe how many NTP hops away a machine is from an authoritative time source. A stratum 1 time server has a radio or atomic clock that is directly attached, a stratum 2 time server receives its time from a stratum 1 time server, and so on. A machine running NTP automatically chooses as its time source the machine with the lowest stratum number that it is configured to communicate with through NTP. This strategy effectively builds a self-organizing tree of NTP speakers.</xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>NTP has two ways to avoid synchronizing to a machine whose time might be ambiguous:</xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>•NTP never synchronizes to a machine that is not synchronized itself.</xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>•NTP compares the time that is reported by several machines and does not synchronize to a machine whose time is significantly different from the others, even if its stratum is lower.</xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>The communications between machines running NTP, known as associations, are usually statically configured; each machine is given the IP addresses of all machines with which it should form associations. An associated pair of machines can keep accurate timekeeping by exchanging NTP messages between each other. However, in a LAN environment, you can configure NTP to use IP broadcast messages. With this alternative, you can configure the machine to send or receive broadcast messages, but the accuracy of timekeeping is marginally reduced because the information flow is one-way only.</xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>Cisco's implementation of NTP does not support stratum 1 service; it is not possible to connect to a radio or atomic clock. We recommend that you obtain the time service for your network from the public NTP servers available on the IP Internet.</xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>If the network is isolated from the Internet, Cisco's NTP implementation allows a machine to be configured so that it acts as though it is synchronized using NTP, when it actually has determined the time using other methods. Other machines synchronize to that machine using NTP.</xhtml:p>

                              <xhtml:p>An important aspect of the VRRP redundancy scheme is VRRP router priority. Priority determines the role that each VRRP router plays and what happens if the master virtual router fails.</xhtml:p>
                              <xhtml:p>If a VRRP router owns the IP address of the virtual router and the IP address of the physical interface, this router functions as a master virtual router.</xhtml:p>
                              <xhtml:p>Priority also determines if a VRRP router functions as a backup virtual router and determines the order of ascendancy to becoming a master virtual router if the master virtual router fails. You can configure the priority of each backup virtual router with a value of 1 through 254, using the vrrp priority command.</xhtml:p>
                              <xhtml:p>For example, if Router A, the master virtual router in a LAN topology, fails, an election process takes place to determine if backup virtual Routers B or C should take over. If Routers B and C are configured with the priorities of 101 and 100, respectively, Router B is elected to become master virtual router because it has the higher priority. If Routers B and C are both configured with the priority of 100, the backup virtual router with the higher IP address is elected to become the master virtual router.</xhtml:p>
                              <xhtml:p>By default, a preemptive scheme is enabled whereby a higher-priority backup virtual router that becomes available takes over for the backup virtual router that was elected to become master virtual router. You can disable this preemptive scheme using the no vrrp preempt command. If preemption is disabled, the backup virtual router that is elected to become master virtual router remains the master until the original master virtual router recovers and becomes master again.</xhtml:p>

HSRP provides high network availability, because it routes IP traffic from hosts on networks without relying on the availability of any single router. HSRP is used in a group of routers for selecting an active router and a standby router. (An active router is the router of choice for routing packets; a standby router is a router that takes over the routing duties when an active router fails, or when preset conditions are met.</xhtml:p>
