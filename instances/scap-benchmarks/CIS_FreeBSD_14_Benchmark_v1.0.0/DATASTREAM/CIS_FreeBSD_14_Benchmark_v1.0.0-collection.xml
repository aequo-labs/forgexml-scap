         <xccdf:notice id="terms-of-use" xml:lang="en">	BACKGROUND.
	The Center for Internet Security ("CIS") provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to Internet users worldwide.	Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally generic in nature.	The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and devices.	Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to specific user requirements.	The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick fix" for anyone's information security needs.
	NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS.
	CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of	the Products or the Recommendations.	CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is" and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind.	USER AGREEMENTS.
	By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We") agree and acknowledge that:
	1.	No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component can be made fully secure;
	2.	We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our own risk;
	3.	We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from 		CIS's negligence or failure to perform; 
	4.	We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the 			Recommendations to our particular circumstances and requirements;
	5.	Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below) has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify us of 		the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and
	6.	Neither CIS nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise) for 		any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or damage 		to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, 	business interruption, wasted management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties) arising out of or in any way 	Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such 	damages), including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, 	viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other harmful items.
	GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS.
	CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use:
	1.	Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and 	use each of the Products on a single computer;
	2.	Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided 		that all such copies are printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed Terms of Use in its entirety.
	RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTION.
	The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and by international treaties.	We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties.	CIS reserves all rights not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights."
	Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute, encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device, without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi) use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product.	We will not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed in this paragraph.
	We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers, directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates, licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim.	We further agree that all CIS Parties are third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use.	SPECIAL RULES.
	CIS has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship.	Those special rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are covered by the special rules.
	CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization, whether by manual or electronic means.	Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time.
	CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION; VENUE.
	We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.	If any of these Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
	BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN ALL RESPECTS.</xccdf:notice>

FreeBSD ships with support for multiple different filesystems but FreeBSD defaults to being installed with one of either UFS (Unix File System) or ZFS (Zettabyte File System). ZFS should not be confused with zFS(Z/OS File System) from IBM which is a different and unrelated file systems. FreeBSD also has the necessary support for reading and writing to traditional Linux file system specifically ext2, ext3 and ext4 with the help of the                                         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ext2fs</xhtml:span>

A single FreeBSD RELEASE comes with a number of artifacts. Those serves different purposes and also has a large effect in terms of file systems. The                                         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">dvd1</xhtml:span>

                     <xhtml:p>UFS is a battle tested file system in the UNIX history line and is suitable for embedded devices in today's context. Whereas ZFS is suitable for large systems specially with large number of storage disks. Although ZFS is memory hungry the tradeoff between the price performance is huge. Depending on the usage type FreeBSD can be installed in either UFS or ZFS. For most of the recommendations in this chapter UFS will be preferred over ZFS. As there are a large number of Cloud Users who often do not need to run large systems often prefer UFS over ZFS too. Clients often need to run micro services on smaller cloud instances where ZFS cannot scale. Although for bare metal servers ZFS is preferred.</xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the system. If a filesystem type is not needed it should be disabled. Native UFS and ZFS file systems are designed to ensure that built-in security controls function as expected. Non-native filesystems can lead to unexpected consequences to both the security and functionality of the system and should be used with caution. Many filesystems are created for niche use cases and are not maintained and supported as the operating systems are updated and patched. Users of non-native filesystems should ensure that there is attention and ongoing support for them, especially in light of frequent operating system changes.</xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>Standard network connectivity and Internet access to cloud storage may make the use of non-standard filesystem formats to directly attach heterogeneous devices much less attractive.</xhtml:p>

 you are repartitioning a system that has already been installed (This may require the system to be in single-user mode):
                                              <xhtml:ul>
                              <xhtml:li>


Mount the new partition to a temporary mountpoint e.g.                                                           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">mount /dev/ada0p3 /mnt</xhtml:span>
                              </xhtml:li>
                              <xhtml:li>


Copy data from the original partition to the new partition. e.g.                                                           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">cp -a /var/tmp/* /mnt</xhtml:span>
                              </xhtml:li>
                              <xhtml:li>


Verify that all data is present on the new partition. e.g.                                                           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ls -la /mnt</xhtml:span>
                              </xhtml:li>
                              <xhtml:li>


Unmount the new partition. e.g.                                                           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umount /mnt</xhtml:span>
                              </xhtml:li>
                              <xhtml:li>


Remove the data from the original directory that was in the old partition. e.g.                                                           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rm -Rf /var/tmp/*</xhtml:span>


 Otherwise it will still consume space in the old partition that will be masked when the new filesystem is mounted.                                                    </xhtml:li>
                              <xhtml:li>


Mount the new partition to the desired mountpoint. e.g.                                                           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">mount /dev/da1 /var/tmp</xhtml:span>
                              </xhtml:li>

 directory contains user generated data, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to                                                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/home</xhtml:span>

 directory may contain world-writable files and directories, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole.

 directory contains log files which can grow quite large, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole.                                              </xhtml:p>

 file which can grow quite large, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to                                                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/audit</xhtml:span>

Large enterprises may choose to install local updates to a server that can be used in place of their distributions servers, whereas a single deployment of a system may get updates directly.

                  <xhtml:p>Mandatory Access Control (MAC) provides additional access restrictions to processes on top of the base Discretionary Access Controls. The potential impact of system vulnerabilities can be reduced by restricting how processes can access files and resources on a system.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>FreeBSD supports security extensions based on the POSIX®.1e draft. These security mechanisms include file system Access Control Lists (“Access Control Lists”) and Mandatory Access Control (MAC). MAC allows access control modules to be loaded to implement security policies. Some modules protect a narrow subset of the system, hardening a particular service. Others provide comprehensive labeled security across all subjects and objects. The mandatory part of the definition indicates that administrators and the operating system enforce controls. This contrasts the default security mechanism of Discretionary Access Control (DAC) where enforcement is left to users' discretion.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:strong>IMPACT:</xhtml:strong>


 Mandatory Access Control limits the capabilities of applications and daemons on a system. While this can prevent unauthorized access, the configuration of MAC can be complex and difficult to implement correctly, preventing legitimate access from occurring.                            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:strong>WARNING:</xhtml:strong>


 Improper MAC configuration may cause loss of system access, aggravation of users, or inability to access the features provided by Xorg. More importantly, MAC should not be relied upon to secure a system completely. The MAC framework only augments an existing security policy. The system will never be completely secure without sound security practices and regular security checks.                            </xhtml:p>

Guidelines published by the US Department of Defense require that warning messages include at least the name of the organization that owns the system, the fact that the system is subject to monitoring and that such monitoring is in compliance with local statutes, and that use of the system implies consent to such monitoring. It is important that the organization's legal counsel review the content of all messages before any system modifications are made, as these warning messages are inherently site-specific.

               <xhtml:p>While applying system updates and patches helps correct known vulnerabilities, one of the best ways to protect the system against as yet unreported vulnerabilities is to disable all services that are not required for normal system operation. This prevents the exploitation of vulnerabilities discovered at a later date. If a service is not enabled, it cannot be exploited. The actions in this section of the document provide guidance on some services which can be safely disabled and under which circumstances, greatly reducing the number of possible threats to the resulting system.

A Smurf attack relies on an attacker sending large amounts of ICMP broadcast messages with a spoofed source address.

If many hosts respond to the packets, the amount of traffic on the network could be significantly multiplied.</xhtml:p>

 disables the system from accepting source routed packets. Assume this system was capable of routing packets to Internet routable addresses on one interface and private addresses on another interface. Assume that the private addresses were not routable to the Internet routable addresses and vice versa. Under normal routing circumstances, an attacker from the Internet routable addresses could not use the system as a way to reach the private address systems. If, however, source routed packets were allowed, they could be used to gain access to the private address systems as the route could be specified, rather than rely on routing protocols that did not allow this routing.                                  </xhtml:p>

 is set, the kernel will handle TCP SYN packets normally until the half-open connection queue is full, at which time, the SYN cookie functionality kicks in. SYN cookies work by not using the SYN queue at all. Instead, the kernel simply replies to the SYN with a SYN/ACK, but will include a specially crafted TCP sequence number that encodes the source and destination IP address and port number and the time the packet was sent. A legitimate connection would send the ACK packet of the three way handshake with the specially crafted sequence number. This allows the system to verify that it has received a valid response to a SYN cookie and allow the connection, even though there is no corresponding SYN in the queue.                                  </xhtml:p>

                     <xhtml:p>ICMPv6 RAs(Router Advertisements) are intended to help facilitate bootstrapping the connectivity of an IPv6 node on a network. They tell the hosts on the LAN how they should go about acquiring their global unicast IPv6 address and become productive members of the network. The RA also provides the end-node information about the local router and its ability to be the default gateway. This process is well documented in Section 4 of the IETF RFC 4861 “Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)”.</xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>Unfortunately, there are some security risks related to ICMPv6 RA messages. On networks that do not yet use IPv6, the dual-stack hosts sit dormant waiting for an eventual RA message to awaken their IPv6 connectivity. An attacker can craft a “rogue RA” message on these networks, get the dual-protocol nodes on the network to configure their IPv6 addresses and utilize the attacker’s system as their default gateway. The attacker can then easily perform a Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack without the user’s knowledge using this technique. This issue is documented in RFC 6104 “Rogue IPv6 Router Advertisement Problem Statement”.  On networks that already have IPv6 running, rogue RAs can destabilize the network (and still perform a MITM attack).</xhtml:p>

It is recommended that systems do not accept router advertisements as they could be tricked into routing traffic to compromised machines. Setting hard routes within the system (usually a single default route to a trusted router) protects the system from bad routes.

 utility allows some moderately complex time specifications.  It accepts times of the form HHMM or HH:MM to run a job at a specific time of day. (If that time is already past, the next day is assumed.) As an alternative, the following keywords may be specified: midnight, noon, or teatime (4pm) and time-of-day may be suffixed with AM or PM for running in the morning or the evening.  The day on which the job is to be run may also be specified by giving a date in the form month-name day with an optional year, or giving a date of the forms DD.MM.YYYY, DD.MM.YY, MM/DD/YYYY, MM/DD/YY, MMDDYYYY, or MMDDYY.  The specification of a date must follow the specification of the time of day.  Time can also be specified as: [now] + count time-units, where the time-units can be minutes, hours, days, weeks, months or years and at may be told to run the job today by suffixing the time with today and to run the job tomorrow by suffixing the time with tomorrow.                                        </xhtml:p>
                        <xhtml:p>For example, to run a job at 4pm three days from now, use at 4pm + 3 days, to run a job at 10:00am on July 31, use at 10am Jul 31 and to run a job at 1am tomorrow, use at 1am tomorrow.</xhtml:p>

 To clarify, the two settings described below are only meant for idle connections from a protocol perspective and are not meant to check if the user is active or not. An idle user does not mean an idle connection. SSH does not and never had, intentionally, the capability to drop idle users.

 there was a bug that caused these values to behave in such a manner that they were abused to disconnect idle users. This bug has been resolved in                                         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">8.2p1</xhtml:span>

 Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd(8) will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client.                                              </xhtml:p>

                              <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveCountMax</xhtml:span>


 Sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without sshd(8) receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the session.  It is important to note that the use of client alive messages is very different from TCPKeepAlive. The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel and therefore will not be spoofable. The TCP keepalive option en‐abled by TCPKeepAlive is spoofable. The client alive mechanism is valuable when the client or server depend on knowing when a connection has become unresponsive.
The default value is 3. If ClientAliveInterval is set to 15, and ClientAliveCountMax is left at the default, unresponsive SSH clients will be disconnected after approximately 45 seconds. Setting a zero ClientAliveCountMax disables connection termination.                                              </xhtml:p>

SSH provides several logging levels with varying amounts of verbosity. The                                         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">DEBUG</xhtml:span>


 options are specifically                                         <xhtml:strong>not</xhtml:strong>


 recommended other than strictly for debugging SSH communications. These levels provide so much data that it is difficult to identify critical security information and may violate users' privacy. Also, improper usage of                                         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">DEBUG</xhtml:span>


 may quickly fill up the available hard disk space, making the system unavailable.                                  </xhtml:p>

The                                         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">INFO</xhtml:span>


 level is the basic level that only records the login activity of SSH users. In many situations, such as Incident Response, it is essential to determine when a particular user was active on a system. The logout record can eliminate disconnected users, which helps narrow the field.                                  </xhtml:p>

Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) is a service that implements modular authentication modules on UNIX systems. PAM is implemented as a set of shared objects that are loaded and executed when a program needs to authenticate a user. Files for PAM are typically located in the                                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/pam.d</xhtml:span>

               <xhtml:p>The items in this section describe how to configure logging, log monitoring, and auditing, using tools included in FreeBSD.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>


It is recommended that                             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">syslog</xhtml:span>


 be used for logging and                             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">auditd</xhtml:span>


 be used for auditing to automatically monitor logs for intrusion attempts and other suspicious system behavior.                      </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>In addition to the local log files created by the steps in this section, it is also recommended that sites collect copies of their system logs on a secure, centralized log server via an encrypted connection. Not only does centralized logging help sites correlate events that may be occurring on multiple systems, but having a second copy of the system log information may be critical after a system compromise where the attacker has modified the local log files on the affected system(s). If a log correlation system is deployed, configure it to process the logs described in this section.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>


Because it is often necessary to correlate log information from many different systems (particularly after a security incident) it is recommended that the time be synchronized among systems and devices connected to the local network. The standard Internet protocol for time synchronization is the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which is supported by most network-ready devices.

                  <xhtml:strong>Note on log file permissions:</xhtml:strong>


 There really isn't a "one size fits all" solution to the permissions on log files. Many sites utilize group permissions so that administrators who are in a defined security group, such as "wheel" do not have to elevate privileges to root to read log files. Also, if a third-party log aggregation tool is used, it may need to have group permissions to read the log files, which is preferable to having it run setuid to root. Therefore, there are two remediation and audit steps for log file permissions. One is for systems that do not have a secured group method implemented that only permits root to read the log files (                            <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root:root 600</xhtml:span>


). The other is for sites that do have such a setup and are designated as                             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root:securegrp 640 </xhtml:span>


where                             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">securegrp</xhtml:span>


 is the defined security group (in some cases                             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">wheel</xhtml:span>


).                      </xhtml:p>

The Auditing System operates on a set of rules that collects certain types of system activity to facilitate incident investigation and detect unauthorized access or modification of data. By default, events will be logged to the                                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/audit/</xhtml:span>


 directory, which can be configured in                                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/security/audit_control</xhtml:span>

                  <xhtml:p>The recommendations in this section implement auditing policies that produce large quantities of logged data and may negatively impact system performance. Capacity planning is critical to ensure production environments are not adversely impacted.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Disk space. If a significantly large set of events is captured, additional on-system or off-system storage may need to be allocated. If the logs are not sent to a remote log server, ensure log rotation is implemented; otherwise, the disk will fill up, and the system will halt. Even when logs are sent to a log server, ensure sufficient disk space to allow caching of logs in the case of temporary network outages.</xhtml:p>

                     <xhtml:li>Disk IO. In addition to the amount of data collected, also consider the rate at which logs are generated.</xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>CPU overhead. System call rules might incur considerable CPU overhead. Test the system's open/close syscalls per second with and without the rules to gauge the impact of the rules.</xhtml:li>

                              <xhtml:p>The expiration specification can be one value or two values with the logical conjunction of AND/OR between them. Values for the audit log file age are numbers with the following suffixes:

y		 Log file age in years.</xhtml:p>

                              <xhtml:p>The suffixes on the values are case-sensitive. If both an age and disk space value are used they are separated by AND or OR and both values are used to determine when audit log files expire. In the case of AND, both the age and disk space conditions must be met before the log file is removed. In the case of OR, either condition may expire the log file.  For example:</xhtml:p>
