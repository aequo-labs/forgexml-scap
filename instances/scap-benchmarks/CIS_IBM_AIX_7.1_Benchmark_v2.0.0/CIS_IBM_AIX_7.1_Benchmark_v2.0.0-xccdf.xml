      <xhtml:h3>This is the archive of the CIS IBM AIX 7.1 Benchmark v2.0.0. CIS encourages you to migrate to a more recent, supported version of this technology.</xhtml:h3>
      <xhtml:p>This document, Security Configuration Benchmark for AIX 7.1, provides prescriptive guidance for establishing a secure configuration posture for AIX version 7.1 running on the Power Systems platform. This guide was tested against AIX 7.1 (TL3, TL4 and TL5) installed from IBM base installation media.</xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p>The guidance within requires that operations are being performed as the root user. Non-root users may not be able to access certain areas of the system, especially after remediation has been performed. It is advisable to verify root users path integrity and the integrity of any programs being run prior to execution of commands and scripts included in this benchmark.</xhtml:p>

   <xccdf:notice id="terms-of-use" xml:lang="en">	BACKGROUND.
	The Center for Internet Security ("CIS") provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to Internet users worldwide.	Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally generic in nature.	The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and devices.	Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to specific user requirements.	The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick fix" for anyone's information security needs.
	NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS.
	CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of	the Products or the Recommendations.	CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is" and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind.	USER AGREEMENTS.
	By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We") agree and acknowledge that:
	1.	No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component can be made fully secure;
	2.	We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our own risk;
	3.	We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from 		CIS's negligence or failure to perform; 
	4.	We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the 			Recommendations to our particular circumstances and requirements;
	5.	Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below) has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify us of 		the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and
	6.	Neither CIS nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise) for 		any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or damage 		to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, 	business interruption, wasted management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties) arising out of or in any way 	Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such 	damages), including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, 	viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other harmful items.
	GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS.
	CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use:
	1.	Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and 	use each of the Products on a single computer;
	2.	Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided 		that all such copies are printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed Terms of Use in its entirety.
	RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTION.
	The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and by international treaties.	We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties.	CIS reserves all rights not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights."
	Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute, encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device, without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi) use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product.	We will not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed in this paragraph.
	We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers, directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates, licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim.	We further agree that all CIS Parties are third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use.	SPECIAL RULES.
	CIS has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship.	Those special rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are covered by the special rules.
	CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization, whether by manual or electronic means.	Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time.
	CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION; VENUE.
	We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.	If any of these Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
	BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN ALL RESPECTS.</xccdf:notice>

         <xhtml:p>This benchmark provides security configuration guidance for use during the configuration of the AIX 7.1 Operating System. The scope of the guide is applicable to AIX 7.1 TL-03 SP1 and above. The recommendations in this guide have been explicitly tested on AIX 7.1 TL-03, TL04 and TL05.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:h3>CIS Critical Controls are Leading</xhtml:h3>
         <xhtml:p>
This new version is a major re-write of the previous version (from 2013). The key difference is that recommendations are no longer organized in terms of         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">aixpert</xhtml:span>
 groups. Instead, the document recommendation sections are ordered according to CIS Critical Controls (v8).      </xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>The CIS Controls reflect the combined knowledge of experts from every part of the ecosystem (companies, governments, individuals), with every role (threat responders and analysts, technologists, information technology (IT) operators and defenders, vulnerability-finders, tool makers, solution providers, users, policy-makers, auditors, etc.), and across many sectors (government, power, defense, finance, transportation, academia, consulting, security, IT, etc.), who have banded together to create, adopt, and support the CIS Controls.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:h3>CIS Controls Version 8 Design Principles</xhtml:h3>
         <xhtml:p>When we begin the work of a new version we sit down first to establish “design principles” that will be used to guide the process. These serve as a decision “touchstone” to remind us of what is really important, and of the goals of the CIS Controls. While these have been fairly consistent since the earliest versions of the Controls, we’ve been refining our thinking over the last couple of versions to focus on the role that the Controls play in the total picture of enterprise security.</xhtml:p>

         <xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:li>IG1 - Implementation Group 1</xhtml:li>
         </xhtml:ul>
         <xhtml:p>An IG1 enterprise is small to medium-sized with limited IT and cybersecurity expertise to dedicate towards protecting IT assets and personnel. The principal concern of these enterprises is to keep the business operational, as they have a limited tolerance for downtime. The sensitivity of the data that they are trying to protect is low and principally surrounds employee and financial information.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>Safeguards selected for IG1 should be implementable with limited cybersecurity expertise and aimed to thwart general, non-targeted attacks. These Safeguards will also typically be designed to work in conjunction with small or home office commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and software.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:li>IG2 - Implementation Group 2 (Includes IG1)</xhtml:li>
         </xhtml:ul>
         <xhtml:p>An IG2 enterprise employs individuals responsible for managing and protecting IT infrastructure. These enterprises support multiple departments with differing risk profiles based on job function and mission. Small enterprise units may have regulatory compliance burdens. IG2 enterprises often store and process sensitive client or enterprise information and can withstand short interruptions of service. A major concern is loss of public confidence if a breach occurs.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>Safeguards selected for IG2 help security teams cope with increased operational complexity. Some Safeguards will depend on enterprise-grade technology and specialized expertise to properly install and configure.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:li>IG3 - Implementation Group 3 (Includes IG1 &amp; IG2)</xhtml:li>
         </xhtml:ul>
         <xhtml:p>An IG3 enterprise employs security experts that specialize in the different facets of cybersecurity (e.g., risk management, penetration testing, application security). IG3 assets and data contain sensitive information or functions that are subject to regulatory and compliance oversight. An IG3 enterprise must address availability of services and the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data. Successful attacks can cause significant harm to the public welfare.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>Safeguards selected for IG3 must abate targeted attacks from a sophisticated adversary and reduce the impact of zero-day attacks.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:h3>The role of AIXPERT</xhtml:h3>
         <xhtml:p>
AIXPERT is a very useful tool to enable system configuration and verify configuration using profiles. In this benchmark the role of aixpert is to apply and verify CIS recommendations (as much as possible). CIS Members have access to an AIX build-kit that includes an XML file to apply the recommendations. But         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">aixpert</xhtml:span>
 no longer drives the organization of the benchmark.      </xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:h3>The task of running the benchmark</xhtml:h3>
         <xhtml:p>
As stated above, as much as possible the benchmark         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">document</xhtml:span>
 is organized following CIS Controls, and within sub-sections the recommendation titles are organized, wherever possible, alphabetically. As such, do not expect an         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">audit run</xhtml:span>
 based on the document order to succeed. Explicitly, there are recommendations in section 3.6 (aka Secure Configuration of ...) that will need to resolved before recommendations elsewhere (e.g., sub-sections of Section 3.1, Account Management) will be able to succeed. (The assumption is that will be other (sub-) section dependencies. This is a complex activity and you may need to re-run and remedy multiple times before the task is completed).      </xhtml:p>

         <xccdf:title xml:lang="en">Benchmark Scenarios</xccdf:title>
         <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
            <xhtml:p>This benchmark envisions two scenarios: 1) an existing system that needs to be certified or compared against a corporate standard and 2) hardening and deploying a fresh installation.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:h3>Benchmark scope and prerequisites</xhtml:h3>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:p>
This benchmark is written for securing fully virtualized               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">virtual machines</xhtml:span>
 (VM). On IBM POWER Systems VM's are also called               <xhtml:em>Logical Partitions</xhtml:em>
 (              <xhtml:span class="inline_block">LPAR</xhtml:span>
) or as, simply,               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">partitions</xhtml:span>
.            </xhtml:p>
               </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:p>
Fully virtualized PowerVM LPARs usually don't have any associated hardware devices. Recommendations for securing hard devices have been removed as               <xhtml:em>irrelevant</xhtml:em>
. Even if you can use the benchmark to proof security on non-virtualized LPARs or on hardware (baremetal) systems remember that this benchmark does not include recommendations for securing devices and hardware.            </xhtml:p>
               </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:p>This benchmark is not approved for AIX on other types of hardware or virtualization technologies, such as KVM.</xhtml:p>
               </xhtml:li>
            </xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:p>Another assumption is that AIX administrators do not have physical access to the POWER frame or managed system. The expectation is that physical access is managed by physical room controls and/or is exclusive to service providers (e.g., IAAS) or data center (server room) controls.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:h3>Fresh Installation - better for first-time users</xhtml:h3>
            <xhtml:p>
While the intent is that this benchmark is suitable for both scenario we also expect that for first-time users working from a fresh install of AIX (insecure using default installation selections) and working through the recommendations is the better           <xhtml:em>Initial Approach</xhtml:em>
 to hardening an AIX image.        </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Therefore, the recommended approach of using this guide is to install a vanilla AIX image, via NIM or the AIX product DVD's, followed by the recommendations detailed in this guide and any other corporate standardization i.e. software installation, filesystem and user creation.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>
Once this initial implementation is complete you will have a base image that can be further deployed via a cloning process based on a           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">mksysb backup</xhtml:span>
 of the system. For example, the mksysb image could be deployed via NIM for any subsequent operating system deployments. Additionally, this system image could be prepared for deployment using PowerVC. Either process (using NIM or PowerVC) would provide a standard build mechanism, ensuring compliance to company standards as well as the best practice recommendations detailed in this benchmark.        </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>By beginning with a new install you will have safe, secure, trusted environment for developing any additional (audit/update) scripts that you can use on existing systems.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:h3>Working with existing systems (and CIS Secure Suite advantages)</xhtml:h3>

            <xhtml:p>Before beginning with the benchmark recommendation section we advise setting up a policy for OS (AIX) updates.
AIX updates are either an update within a Technology Level (no AIX features are changed), an update to a new Technology Level (and it current Service Pack).</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>This benchmark does not address AIX migration updates, e.g., from AIX 6.1 to AIX 7.1, or AIX 7.1 to AIX 7.2.</xhtml:li>

            <xhtml:h3>IBM AIX Maintenance Strategy</xhtml:h3>
            <xhtml:p>
The current IBM software maintenance strategy revolves around the release of Technology Levels (TL) and Service Packs (SP). Previously Technology Levels were released twice per year, one in the spring and the other in fall. Currently, if at all, TLs are released annually (in the fall). A Technology introduces support for new hardware, new functionality, and new features and contain cumulative fixes since the release of the previous TL. Historically, the minimum fix support window for a given TL is two years from its release date. IBM is considering (or has already done so) extending this minimum period to three years. Information on the current support window for a given TL can be found on           <xhtml:a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/aix-support-lifecycle-information">https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/aix-support-lifecycle-information</xhtml:a>
.        </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Service Packs are released throughout the lifecycle of the TL and address security vulnerabilities and other critical fixes. For AIX 5.3 and AIX 6.1 they were typically released every 12 weeks; obviously this timeframe is dependent on the number and criticality of the issues found. For AIX 7.1 more than one SP per year is uncommon.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:h3>Setting a  Maintenance Cadence</xhtml:h3>
            <xhtml:p>AIX Service Pack (SP) updates should be applied regularly. As updates are infrequent (sometimes only once per year) a prior policy of being with N-2 updates could keep your organization at nearly two years behind recent updates. We advise to apply a SP within 90 days of it´s release. Recall, the normal release dates are April (if any) and October. There are no hard dates - this estimation is based on observation.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>We recommend starting application testing for a new TL at least a year before the end of (normal) support for the current TL. Frequently your organization may skip an intermediary TL (e.g., from AIX 7.1 TL3 to AIX 7.1 TL5).</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:p>We recommend that full TL's or TL/SP's are applied rather than individual fixes. AIX TL/SP releases go through a rigorous testing process. The large and complex matrix of possible fix combinations are not subjected to the same degree of testing and therefore installing individual fixes is not recommended.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:h3>Interim Fixes, Third Party updates</xhtml:h3>
            <xhtml:p>
A security fix will be initially released as an interim fix. These packages are installed and maintained via the           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">emgr</xhtml:span>
 framework.
Extremely critical security issues should be applied asap. For others you may consider to wait and apply the fix as part of a full SP release. Read the documentation, consider the impact - and do not forget to consider the potential time before the next TL/SP release. When in doubt open a ticket with IBM support and ask when the new SP (for the current TL) is expected.        </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Further, between SP releases IBM may produce interim Security fixes and/or there are so-called Third-Party updates (notably OpenSSL, OpenSSH and Java updates) that are managed separate from SP releases.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>The recommended maintenance strategy is:</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>Review security advisories at least monthly (see below).</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>Before making major system changes (whether security hardening, or an OS update) clone rootvg so that unexpected (adverse) effects can be reverted by rebooting the cloned rootvg.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>Stay current and refresh the TL of each system at least once a year - For maximum system stability do not wait more 90 days before applying a new update. Remember to clone rootvg before updating!</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>Migrate to a newer TL before (when) the installed TL is no longer supported by IBM.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>Review the Service Packs for any security or critical fixes - apply these regularly throughout the life cycle of a TL/SP.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>Do not apply interim fixes or individual fixes unless there is an requirement to do so. If time and priotities permit wait and apply full TL/SP's.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>Repeat system verification after an update. (e.g., file mode changes might be reverted by the update).</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
Frequent backups of rootvg using             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">mksysb</xhtml:span>

From it's first release in AIX 5.2           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">aixpert</xhtml:span>
 has included multiple policies (the tool calls them           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">levels</xhtml:span>
) in the file           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/security/aixpert/core/aixpertall.xml</xhtml:span>
. The first three policies aka levels were:           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">low</xhtml:span>
,           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">medium</xhtml:span>
, and           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">high</xhtml:span>
.        </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>
As an added feature the ability to create a           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">custom</xhtml:span>
 policy using the depreciated technology           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">websm</xhtml:span>
 was added shortly after the initial release.        </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>
To round off the           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">aixpertall.xml</xhtml:span>
 file an additional profiles (level) was added:           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">default</xhtml:span>
.
The           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">default</xhtml:span>
 profile can be used to initiate           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">aixpert</xhtml:span>
 (i.e., create           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/security/aixpert/core/appliedaixpert.xml</xhtml:span>
) so that the command           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">aixpert -c</xhtml:span>
 can be run successfully. Note: it might undo any previous manual configuration. More common is to use the command to compare the current (manual) settings with the           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">default</xhtml:span>
 un-hardended settings.        </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:h3>Default Level Security (DLS)</xhtml:h3>
            <xhtml:p>This policy can be used to reset AIX to it's default (unsecured) settings.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>While not secure - this provides a simple mechanism to restore AIX to a known, though unhardened, configuration. This can be needed to determine if a security setting is blocking a desired application or service availability.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:h3>Low Level Security (LLS)</xhtml:h3>
            <xhtml:p>This policy implements common non-disruptive security enhancements.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Typically this is suited to servers residing in an internal and secure local network environment. It provides a basic security lockdown, from a minimal default level.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:h3>Medium Level Security (MLS)</xhtml:h3>
            <xhtml:p>This policy implements more advanced hardening parameters than the Low Level. These include: port scan protection and an enhanced password management policy. This security level does allow clear text password protocol access, e.g. ftp, rlogin, and telnet.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Typically, this is suited to servers residing in a corporate network protected by a firewall.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:h3>High Level Security (HLS)</xhtml:h3>
            <xhtml:p>This policy implements the highest possible security hardening standards. These include: port scan protection and no access for any clear text password protocols. It assumes that the local network is not trusted and is potentially unsafe.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Typically, this is suited to servers residing in an unsafe network. For example, those which are internet facing.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Within modern IT infrastructure, internal firewalls are typically implemented to separate the internal network from any corporate or internet environments and external firewalls to further protect these environments from the outside world. These firewall devices are typically only configured to allow access to the systems on the required core application or database ports. Therefore, port shunning and scan protection are typically something implemented by a firewall, rather than at the operating system level.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">aixpert</xhtml:span>
 added the flag           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">-P</xhtml:span>

As mentioned in this sections overview -           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">AIXPERT</xhtml:span>
 is a core technology for hardening AIX. To this end IBM AIX provides several default profile levels.        </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>
A starting point for the early AIX benchmarks was the so-called           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">high</xhtml:span>
 level profile. Besides the benchmark, published as a PDF and made available to any interested party,  CIS also provides so-called           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">build-kits</xhtml:span>

            <xhtml:p>
Prior to implementing the AIX Security Expert customized settings, please review the benchmark recommendations. If there are any settings that need to be altered from a CIS recommended value, e.g., based on environmental requirements, edit the XML file using a text editor such as the           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">vi</xhtml:span>
 command.        </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>
As much as possible the guide has been automated based on the AIX Security Expert HLS policy. Some of these settings have been altered from an IBM guideline to a CIS (consensus) value. Further, recommendations normally outside the scope of the HLS policy have been added. These instances either use the standard           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">aixpert</xhtml:span>
 commands or a special           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">aixpert</xhtml:span>

         <xhtml:p>
This benchmark reorganizes the recommendations into sections based on         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">CIS Controls v8</xhtml:span>
. Prior AIX benchmarks were closely aligned with the way         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">aixpert</xhtml:span>
 grouped it's recommendations. Simply put, the organization of the recommendations is "Control"-&gt;"Tool|Command" (aka top-down) rather than "Tool command"-&gt;recommendation (aka bottom-up) driven.      </xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:h3>Excerpts from CIS Controls v8</xhtml:h3>
         <xhtml:p>CIS Controls® started as a simple grassroots activity to identify the most common and important real-world cyber-attacks that affect enterprises every day, translate that knowledge and experience into positive, constructive action for defenders, and then share that information with a wider audience.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>The CIS Controls reflect the combined knowledge of experts from every part of the ecosystem (companies, governments, individuals), with every role (threat responders and analysts, technologists, information technology (IT) operators and defenders, vulnerability-finders, tool makers, solution providers, users, policy-makers, auditors, etc.), and across many sectors (government, power, defense, finance, transportation, academia, consulting, security, IT, etc.), who have banded together to create, adopt, and support the CIS Controls.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:h3>Guiding principles</xhtml:h3>
         <xhtml:p>
CIS Controls v8 used a number of         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">design principles</xhtml:span>
. These served as to remind the community of what is really important and of the goals of the CIS Controls. Several of these design principles were copied or borrowed to help reshape the AIX Benchmark recommendations.      </xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:li>Recommendations are selected, dropped, and prioritized based on data, and on specific knowledge of Attacker behavior and how to stop it</xhtml:li>
            <xhtml:li>Avoid adding “good things to do”</xhtml:li>
            <xhtml:li>Don’t be tempted to solve every security problem, stick to the spirit of “Critical” Security Controls</xhtml:li>
            <xhtml:li>All Sub-Controls (Safeguards) must be specific and practical to implement</xhtml:li>
            <xhtml:li>All Controls, especially for Implementation Group 1 must be measurable</xhtml:li>

               <xhtml:p>This section provides guidance on the configuration of the user attributes that affect password policy. (See CIS Control 5.2: Use Unique Passwords)</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:h3>Other User attributes</xhtml:h3>
               <xhtml:p>
Other attributes manage user/application values             <xhtml:em>after</xhtml:em>
 a successful login. These attributes include             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ulimits</xhtml:span>
,             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
,             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rlogin</xhtml:span>
 and more. Including password controls - there are approximately 65 user attributes.          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>
The recommendations in this section focus on the password related parameters specified in the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">default:</xhtml:span>
 user stanza in the file             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/security/user</xhtml:span>

 stanza.          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>The recommended user management is to not set any of these values explicitly - unless there is a specific requirement to override a default.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:h3>User Management and External Services</xhtml:h3>
               <xhtml:p>
When             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">user access credentials</xhtml:span>
 are managed using an external service many, if not all, of the password related parameters may be managed by the external service. As to             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">other</xhtml:span>
 attributes, when the external service does not support other AIX user attributes (e.g., LDAP and scheme             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rfc2307</xhtml:span>

Historically, this recommendation has been to set                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">maxage=13</xhtml:span>
. In recent years several communities (e.g., Windows, DoD) have concluded that too frequent forced password changes leads to both weaker passwords and weaker/bad password discipline.                  </xhtml:p>
                           <xhtml:p>
An initial proposal to increase the maxage to 52 is not unnamimous within the AIX community - so the recommendation, for now, remains at                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">13</xhtml:span>
.                  </xhtml:p>
                           <xhtml:p>
Local Policy may decide to follow the                     <xhtml:em>other</xhtml:em>
 communities and set this value as 52.                  </xhtml:p>

                        <xhtml:p>
                           <xhtml:p>
The AIX community prefers to rely on the AIX attribute                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">histexpire</xhtml:span>
 rather than a historical                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">minage</xhtml:span>
 value.                  </xhtml:p>
                           <xhtml:p>
Historically, the                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">minage</xhtml:span>
 attribute has been used to prevent a user from write a script to spool through                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">histsize</xhtml:span>
 passwords, and then return to the same password as before. The attribute                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">histexpire</xhtml:span>
 overrides                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">histsize</xhtml:span>
. Therefore, there is no need to force a user to request assistance from system administrators in order to reset a poorly chosen password, or in the case of special accounts that policy states passwords are meant for "one time use".                  </xhtml:p>
                           <xhtml:p>
Again, since AIX has a different way to prevent scripted password re-cycling, the need for                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">minage</xhtml:span>
 is not longer warranted.                  </xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:li>
This section deals with managing (preferred: disable any command-line activity) the generic system accounts i.e.               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">daemon, bin, sys, adm, uucp, nobody</xhtml:span>
 and               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">lpd</xhtml:span>
.            </xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>
Disable is defined as setting attribute               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">account_locked=true</xhtml:span>
,               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rlogin=false</xhtml:span>
,               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">login=false</xhtml:span>
,               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">shell=/bin/false</xhtml:span>
 and               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">sugroups=bin</xhtml:span>
 (as there are no normal accounts with               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">bin</xhtml:span>
 as a group.            </xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>
These accounts exist to own certain files and/or perform a service as a non-root (less privileged) userid. As such, the accounts are NOT to be removed (and files transferred to               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root</xhtml:span>
).            </xhtml:li>
               </xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:p>Motivation:</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:ul>
                  <xhtml:li>There is no reason that these userid's have any access to a shell - whether through a login or su(do).</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>
There is no need for an encrypted password in the shadow file. Better is to leave the shadow password as the single character '*' as that will never resolve to a normal password - effectively blocking               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">login</xhtml:span>
 and               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">su</xhtml:span>
 operations.            </xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>
Not even               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">su</xhtml:span>
 as root needs to succeed.            </xhtml:li>
               </xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:p>Exception:</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:ul>
                  <xhtml:li>
There should not be a requirement to log in as any of these users directly. However, if a need does arise access should be regulated via the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">sudoers</xhtml:span>
 attribute (document the group creation and assignment) so that the legitimate user may               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">su</xhtml:span>
 from there own account to ensure traceability and accountability. This also implies that a real encrypted (as sha512) password will exist in the shadow password file.            </xhtml:li>

                  <xhtml:p>The choice between sudo and enhanced RBAC revolves around whether or not the environment is heterogeneous in nature, running different flavors of UNIX, or perhaps different versions of AIX. It may be that sudo is the standard tool of choice for managing privileged command access across an entire UNIX estate. However, if the environment is AIX 6.1+ only, it is recommended that enhanced RBAC is used as the tool of choice. Some implementations however may benefit from a combined approach, utilizing both sudo and enhanced RBAC.</xhtml:p>

inittab (called by rc.boot phase 3) and is compareable to             <xhtml:strong>SYSV</xhtml:strong>

 scripts          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
rc.tcpip (called by             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">inittab</xhtml:span>
) and manages the activation of most of the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">SRC</xhtml:span>
 (System Resource Controller) managed services and daemons.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
IPv6 is a separate section (called, if used, by             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rc.tcpip</xhtml:span>
) as most locations do not yet use IPv6. Make sure it is not activated if you are not pursuing IPv6 in your environment.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
inetd.conf: this section is not boot (IPL) related - other than the the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">inetd</xhtml:span>
 service is initiated vi             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rc.tcpip</xhtml:span>
. There is a good chance that none of these services are needed. If they are needed,             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">inetd</xhtml:span>
 provides the service             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">on-demand</xhtml:span>
               </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
NFS: These are recommendations that may be relevant if you are running an NFS server. The script             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/rc.nfs</xhtml:span>
 (called via             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/inittab</xhtml:span>

: On AIX, even if all these supporting programs are stopped the kernel still supports             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">NFS</xhtml:span>
 client activity. If all             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">NFS</xhtml:span>
 activity must be stopped you will need a host-based firewall to block the related port(s).          </xhtml:li>

               <xhtml:p>
Frequently, when the process started is a daemon process, it runs under the UID 0 (aka root) and their parent process id (PPID) is the process             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">init</xhtml:span>
, or PID 1.          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>
In those cases, when these programs exit -             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">init</xhtml:span>
 checks the process's entry in /etc/inittab (            <xhtml:span class="inline_block">init</xhtml:span>

                     <xhtml:p>
The sound related daemons are installed if you install all drivers. Our instructions or example installation (which will be re-written as a recommendation in the AIX 7.2 benchmark) included the comment to                 <xhtml:em>NOT</xhtml:em>

The               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rexd</xhtml:span>
 daemon executes programs for remote machines when a client issues a request to execute a program on a remote machine. The inetd daemon starts the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rexd</xhtml:span>
 daemon from the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/inetd.conf</xhtml:span>
 file.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>
Non-interactive programs use standard file descriptors connected directly to TCP connections. Interactive programs use pseudo-terminals, similar to the login sessions provided by the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rlogin</xhtml:span>
 command. The               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rexd</xhtml:span>
 daemon can use the network file system (NFS) to mount the file systems specified in the remote execution request. Diagnostic messages are normally printed on the console and returned to the requester.            </xhtml:p>

Each NFS export on the server should have the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">anon=-2</xhtml:span>
 option set. With this (default) value               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root</xhtml:span>
 (euid==0) is seen as the account               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">nobody</xhtml:span>
. When               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">anon=0</xhtml:span>
 the remote root user has root access on the NFS mount.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>
By ensuring the export option               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">anon=-2</xhtml:span>
 when a client process with               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">euid==0</xhtml:span>
 attempts to access (read, write, or delete) the NFS mount the server substitutes the UID to the server's nobody account. This means that the root user on the client cannot access or change files that only root on the server can access or change.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>
Many NFS servers call this               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root_squash</xhtml:span>
. On AIX is is called               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">anon</xhtml:span>
. To be consistent with other benchmark terminalogy CIS recommends that               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root_squash</xhtml:span>
 is set on all exported filesystems.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>
On AIX the default value of any exported filesystem or directory for               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">anon</xhtml:span>
 is -2. Thus, when               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">anon</xhtml:span>
 is not set it´s effective value is
              <xhtml:span class="inline_block">-2</xhtml:span>
. Any other value has to be explicitly set.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>
As a more secure option you can set the option to               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">anon=-1</xhtml:span>
. This setting is accepted because it disables anonymous access. By default, secure NFS accepts non-secure requests as anonymous.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>
NOTE: The root user on the client can still use               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">su</xhtml:span>
 to become any other user (change the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">euid</xhtml:span>
) and access and change that users files, assuming that the same user exists on the NFS server and owns files and/or directories in the NFS export.            </xhtml:p>

 Adversaries continue to evolve and mature, as they share, or sell, information among their community on exploits and bypasses to security controls.

            </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:h3>Why is this Section Critical</xhtml:h3>
            <xhtml:p>Data is no longer only contained within an enterprise’s border; it is in the cloud, on portable end-user devices where users work from home, and is often shared with partners or online services that might have it anywhere in the world. In addition to sensitive data an enterprise holds related to finances, intellectual property, and customer data, there also might be numerous international regulations for protection of personal data. Data privacy has become increasingly important, and enterprises are learning that privacy is about the appropriate use and management of data, not just encryption. Data must be appropriately managed through its entire life cycle. These privacy rules can be complicated for multi-national enterprises of any size; however, there are fundamentals that can apply to all.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Once attackers have penetrated an enterprise’s infrastructure, one of their first tasks is to find and exfiltrate data. Enterprises might not be aware that sensitive data is leaving their environment because they are not monitoring data outflows.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>While many attacks occur on the network, others involve physical theft of portable end-user devices, attacks on service providers or other partners holding sensitive data. Other sensitive enterprise assets may also include non-computing devices that provide management and control of physical systems, such as Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>The enterprise’s loss of control over protected or sensitive data is a serious and often reportable business impact. While some data is compromised or lost as a result of theft or espionage, the vast majority are a result of poorly understood data management rules, and user error. The adoption of data encryption, both in transit and at rest, can provide mitigation against data compromise, and, even more important, it is a regulatory requirement for most controlled data.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>
Another enhancement of AIX 6.1 is the introduction of Encrypted Filesystems. This enables an individual user, via keystore files, to encrypt their own data within a             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">jfs2 </xhtml:span>
filesystem. After creating EFS enabled filesystems, individual files can be encrypted or inheritance can be set at the filesystem or directory level. The standard AIX data and user management commands have been modified to work with encryption.          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>There are a number of reasons for encrypting data in this manner, perhaps to send backups of data off site, or to encrypt sensitive or confidential information such as payroll details.</xhtml:p>

The user file-creation mode mask (            <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
) is used to determine the file permission for newly
created directories and files. In AIX, the default permissions for any newly created
directory is 0755 (rwxr-xr-x), and for any newly created file it is 0644 (rw-r--r--). The
            <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 modifies the default AIX permissions by restricting (masking) these permissions.
The             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>

            <xhtml:h3>Why is this Section Critical?</xhtml:h3>
            <xhtml:p>As delivered from manufacturers and resellers, the default configurations for enterprise assets and software are normally geared towards ease-of-deployment and ease-of-use rather than security. Basic controls, open services and ports, default accounts or passwords, pre-configured Domain Name System (DNS) settings, older (vulnerable) protocols, and pre-installation of unnecessary software can all be exploitable if left in their default state. Further, these security configuration updates need to be managed and maintained over the life cycle of enterprise assets and software. Configuration updates need to be tracked and approved through configuration management workflow process to maintain a record that can be reviewed for compliance, leveraged for incident response, and to support audits. This CIS Control is important to on-premises devices, as well as remote devices, network devices, and cloud environments.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Service providers play a key role in modern infrastructures, especially for smaller enterprises. They often are not set up by default in the most secure configuration to provide flexibility for their customers to apply their own security policies. Therefore, the presence of default accounts or passwords, excessive access, or unnecessary services are common in default configurations. These could introduce weaknesses that are under the responsibility of the enterprise that is using the software, rather than the service provider. This extends to ongoing management and updates, as some Platform as a Service (PaaS) only extend to the operating system, so patching and updating hosted applications are under the responsibility of the enterprise.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Even after a strong initial configuration is developed and applied, it must be continually managed to avoid degrading security as software is updated or patched, new security vulnerabilities are reported, and configurations are “tweaked,” to allow the installation of new software or to support new operational requirements.</xhtml:p>

If this option is set to prohibit-password (or its deprecated alias, without-password), password and keyboard-interactive authentication are disabled for root.
If this option is set to forced-commands-only, root login with public key authentication will be allowed, but only if the command option has been specified (which may be useful for taking remote backups even if root login is normally not allowed). All other authentication methods are disabled for root.
If this option is set to no, root is not allowed to log in.</xhtml:p>

One setting would be to block all root access (by assinging the value                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">no</xhtml:span>
 to                     <xhtml:em>PermitRootLogin</xhtml:em>
.). While this sounds simple - setting the attribute to                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">no</xhtml:span>
 requires either sharing a root password (to use                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">su</xhtml:span>
), the installation of                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">sudo</xhtml:span>
, or a configuration using                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">extended RBAC</xhtml:span>
 for actions that require enhanced privileges.                  </xhtml:p>
                           <xhtml:p>
Considering the recommendation                     <xhtml:strong>3.2.6.9 - Configuring SSH - set LogLevel to INFO</xhtml:strong>
 specifies a LOG_LEVEL of                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">INFO</xhtml:span>
 or                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">DEBUG</xhtml:span>
 a setting of                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">prohibit-password</xhtml:span>
 is acceptable. In short, unless                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">no</xhtml:span>
 is required by local corporate policy the preferred setting is to disable root login using a password and verify that OpenSSH logging is at least at level                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">INFO</xhtml:span>

                  <xhtml:p>Based on research conducted at various institutions, it was determined that the symmetric portion of the SSH Transport Protocol (as described in RFC 4253) has security weaknesses that allowed recovery of up to 32 bits of plaintext from a block of ciphertext that was encrypted with the Cipher Block Chaining (CBD) method. From that research, new Counter mode algorithms (as described in RFC4344) were designed that are not vulnerable to these types of attacks and these algorithms are now recommended for standard use.</xhtml:p>

A development since AIX 5.1 was the ability to use different password algorithms as defined in               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/security/pwdalg.cfg</xhtml:span>
. The traditional UNIX password algorithm is               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">crypt</xhtml:span>
, which is a one-way hash function supporting only 8 character passwords. The use of brute force password guessing attacks means that               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">crypt</xhtml:span>
 no longer provides an appropriate level of security and so other encryption mechanisms are recommended.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>
The recommendation of this benchmark is to set the password algorithm to               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ssha512</xhtml:span>
. This algorithm supports long passwords, up to 255 characters in length and allows passphrases including the use of the extended ASCII table and the space character. Any passwords already set using               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">crypt</xhtml:span>
 will be recognized. When the password is reset the new password hash algorithm will be used to encrypt the password.            </xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>This section provides guidance on the so-called historical services. These are services that are still installed - often by default - but the base recommendation is to uninstall the services whenever possible, and disable them when they cannot be removed.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>The basic recommendations: remove or disable falls under IG1. Some of these services may be used, after proper configuration. Such a service should be viewed as part of an IG2 or IG3 solution.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>
In another section recommendations have already been made to disable the remote services in             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/inetd.conf</xhtml:span>
. While this stops the server from accepting connections disabling the binaries themselves ensures connections from the server to another host are further restricted, i.e., the daemons themselves are fully disabled.          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>There are many (well) known security vulnerabilities related to these services and they are a primary target for any DoS attack.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>In short, unless otherwise required, the IG1 recommendation is that the services and daemons covered in this section and it's subsections are either removed from the system or have their file mode permissions removed.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>Network Information Service (NIS) or Yellow Pages (YP), is a client/server directory service protocol used for distributing system configuration data, such as: users, groups, passwords and hosts between computers in a network. This is typically done in larger environments to centralize the management of this data. If the NIS software is installed but not configured, an attacker can cripple a machine by starting NIS. In environments where NIS is utilized, tools like ypsnarfallow an attacker to grab the contents of your NIS maps, providing large amounts of information about your site.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>The first recommendation in this section is to de-install NIS, if it is installed, to lockdown this service. However, if NIS is used in the environment it is recommended that NIS+ is used instead. NIS+ is structured differently from NIS and supports secure and encrypted RPC, which resolves many of the security issues.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>The configuration of NIS+ is not within the scope of this benchmark; however the links below can be used for initial reference:</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a commonly used service that provides network management and monitoring capabilities. SNMP offers the capability to poll networked devices and monitor data such as utilization and errors from various subsystems on the host. SNMP is also capable of changing the configurations on the host, allowing remote management of the system. The protocol uses a community string for authentication from the SNMP client to the SNMP agent on the managed device.</xhtml:p>

, are enabled with read/write privileges, but only allow access from localhost connections. Nevertheless, a local user may install an SNMP client and modify sensitive variables. If SNMP is required, the community strings must be greater than six characters and include a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters to avoid a brute force attack.            </xhtml:p>

TE has two modes of operation, online and offline. The online mode provides the most comprehensive security, as a check is made every time a file is loaded into memory. If the integrity checks fail, the file will not be loaded into memory. The offline mode checks file integrity at a specified time, via either the command line or via             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">crontab</xhtml:span>

To further enhance the local               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">syslog</xhtml:span>
 logging process CIS recommends that               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">syslog</xhtml:span>
 information, in particular that generated by the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">auth</xhtml:span>
 facility, is logged remotely. This recommendation assumes that a remote and secure syslog server is available on the network. If this is not the case, please skip to the next recommendation.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>The primary reason for logging remotely is to provide an un-editable audit trail of system access. If a hacker were to access a system and gain super user authority it would be easy to edit local files and remove all traces of access, providing the system administrator with no way of identifying the individual or group responsible. If the log data is sent remotely at the point of access, these remote logs can then be reconciled with local data to identify tampered and altered files. The logs can also be used as evidence in any subsequent prosecution.</xhtml:p>
