         <xccdf:notice id="terms-of-use" xml:lang="en">	BACKGROUND.
	The Center for Internet Security ("CIS") provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to Internet users worldwide.	Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally generic in nature.	The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and devices.	Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to specific user requirements.	The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick fix" for anyone's information security needs.
	NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS.
	CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of	the Products or the Recommendations.	CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is" and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind.	USER AGREEMENTS.
	By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We") agree and acknowledge that:
	1.	No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component can be made fully secure;
	2.	We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our own risk;
	3.	We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from 		CIS's negligence or failure to perform; 
	4.	We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the 			Recommendations to our particular circumstances and requirements;
	5.	Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below) has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify us of 		the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and
	6.	Neither CIS nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise) for 		any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or damage 		to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, 	business interruption, wasted management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties) arising out of or in any way 	Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such 	damages), including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, 	viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other harmful items.
	GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS.
	CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use:
	1.	Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and 	use each of the Products on a single computer;
	2.	Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided 		that all such copies are printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed Terms of Use in its entirety.
	RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTION.
	The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and by international treaties.	We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties.	CIS reserves all rights not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights."
	Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute, encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device, without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi) use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product.	We will not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed in this paragraph.
	We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers, directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates, licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim.	We further agree that all CIS Parties are third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use.	SPECIAL RULES.
	CIS has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship.	Those special rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are covered by the special rules.
	CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization, whether by manual or electronic means.	Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time.
	CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION; VENUE.
	We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.	If any of these Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
	BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN ALL RESPECTS.</xccdf:notice>

. Assigning the correct user authority will help ensure that applications can function properly, while not giving overly permissive permissions on the system. These identities can further be used in ACLs to protect system content. It is recommended that each Application Pool run under a unique identity.                            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>IIS has additional built-in least privilege identities intended for use by Application Pools. It is recommended that the default Application Pool Identity be changed to a least privilege principle other than Network Service. Furthermore, it is recommended that all application pool identities be assigned a unique least privilege principal.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>To achieve isolation in IIS, application pools can be run as separate identities. IIS can be configured to automatically use the application pool identity if no anonymous user account is configured for a Web site. This can greatly reduce the number of accounts needed for Web sites and make management of the accounts easier. It is recommended the Application Pool Identity be set as the Anonymous User Identity.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>


The name of the Application Pool account corresponds to the name of the Application Pool. Application Pool Identities were introduced in Windows Server 2008 SP2. It is recommended that Application Pools be set to run as                                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ApplicationPoolIdentity</xhtml:span>


 unless there is an underlying reason that the application pool needs to run as a specified end user account. One example where this is needed is for web farms using Kerberos authentication.                            </xhtml:p>

Challenge-based authentication and login redirection-based authentication methods cannot be used in conjunction with one another.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Public servers/sites are typically configured to use Anonymous Authentication. This method typically works, provided the content or services is intended for use by the public. When sites, applications, or specific content containers are not intended for anonymous public use, an appropriate authentication mechanism should be utilized. Authentication will help confirm the identity of clients who request access to sites, application, and content. IIS provides the following authentication modules by default:</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:ul>
                     <xhtml:li>Anonymous Authentication - allows anonymous users to access sites, applications, and/or content</xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>Integrated Windows Authentication - authenticates users using the NTLM or Kerberos protocols; Kerberos v5 requires a connection to Active Directory</xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>ASP.NET Impersonation - allows ASP.NET applications to run under a security context different from the default security context for an application</xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>Forms Authentication - enables a user to login to the configured space with a valid user name and password which is then validated against a database or other credentials store</xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>Basic authentication - requires a valid user name and password to access content</xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>Client Certificate Mapping Authentication - allows automatic authentication of users who log on with client certificates that have been configured; requires SSL</xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>Digest Authentication - uses Windows domain controller to authenticate users who request access</xhtml:li>
                  </xhtml:ul>
                  <xhtml:p>Note that none of the challenge-based authentication modules can be used at the same time Forms Authentication is enabled for certain applications/content. Forms Authentication does not rely on IIS authentication, so anonymous access for the ASP.NET application can be configured if Forms Authentication will be used.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>It is recommended that sites containing sensitive information, confidential data, or non-public web services be configured with a credentials-based authentication mechanism.</xhtml:p>

 switch is intended for use by production IIS servers. This switch is used to help applications run with the best possible performance and least possible security information leakages by disabling the application's ability to generate trace output on a page, disabling the ability to display detailed error messages to end users, and disabling the debug switch. Often times, switches and options that are developer-focused, such as failed request tracing and debugging, are enabled during active development. It is recommended that the deployment method on any production server be set to                                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">retail</xhtml:span>

Session information can also be stored in the URL. However, storing session information in this manner has security implications that can open attack vectors such as session hijacking. An effective method used to prevent session hijacking attacks is to force web applications to use cookies to store the session token.

               <xhtml:p>Introduced in IIS 7.0 for the first time, Request Filtering is a powerful module that provides a configurable set of rules that enables administrators to allow or reject the types of requests that they determine should be allowed or rejected at the server, web site, or web application levels.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Earlier versions of Internet Information Services provided the tool UrlScan, which was provided as an add-on to enable system administrators to enforce tighter security policies on their web servers. All of the core features of URLScan have been incorporated into the Request Filtering module. Due to the close nature of functionality in these two tools, reference to legacy URLScan settings will be made where applicable.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>IIS 8 also introduced modules for Dynamic IP Address Restrictions. This module can be configured to automatically block web site access based on specific rules.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Note: Request Filtering and IP and Domain Restrictions must be enabled as a role service under IIS in order to configure any of its features.</xhtml:p>

 Request Filter is the maximum size of the http request, measured in bytes, which can be sent from a client to the server. Configuring this value enables the total request size to be restricted to a configured value.

This Request Filter feature prevents attacks that rely on double-encoded requests and applies if an attacker submits a double-encoded request to IIS. When the double-encoded requests filter is enabled, IIS will go through a two iteration process of normalizing the request. If the first normalization differs from the second, the request is rejected and the error code is logged as a 404.11. The double-encoded requests filter was the                                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">VerifyNormalization</xhtml:span>

The HTTP TRACE method returns the contents of client HTTP requests in the entity-body of the TRACE response.

               <xhtml:p>This section contains recommendations for configuring IIS protocols and cipher suites.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>For security protocols (SSL, TLS), there are 2 registry paths that control a protocol state in the O/S: TLS client and TLS server. A web server normally acts as the TLS server in that it is serving web content to clients. There are some instances where a web server is configured as a 'client'. An example of a server acting as a client can be seen when there is dynamic content generation. The webserver queries a remote database server to return content specific to a user's request. In this configuration, the web server is acting as a TLS client. In cases such as these, the configured TLS server protocol and cipher suite preferences take precedence over the client’s. This behavior is why for the IIS benchmark we require specific protocol settings for a TLS server and only recommend settings for TLS clients.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>If SSLv3 registry keys are not set, the O/S defaults take precedence.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>


For example, to disable SSLv3 protocol on the TLS server, you need to set the following registry key to 0:
                            <xhtml:span class="inline_block">HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\SSL 3.0\Server\Enabled</xhtml:span>
               </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>


To prevent a client from issuing the Hello command over that legacy protocol the following registry must be set to 0:
                            <xhtml:span class="inline_block">HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\SSL 3.0\Client\Enabled</xhtml:span>
               </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>The fact that the key is named Enabled can be confusing. The setting of the value to either 0 or 1 actually sets the state of the protocol. 0 being disabled and 1 being enabled.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>


Here are some specifics into how  "Enabled" and "DisabledByDefault” registry settings work. The following article,                             <xhtml:a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/245030/how-to-restrict-the-use-of-certain-cryptographic-algorithms-and-protocols-in-schannel.dll">How to restrict the use of certain cryptographic algorithms and protocols in Schannel.dll</xhtml:a>


, provides additional information related to controlling these protocols and ciphers.                      </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Using the “Enabled = 0” registry setting disables the protocol in a way that can’t be overridden by application settings. This is the only robust way to prevent  the protocol from being used and no additional settings are required. At the same time, using the “DisabledByDefault” registry setting only prevents that protocol from issuing the Hello command over that protocol when an SSL connection with a server is initiated. This O/S level setting can be overwritten by an application which has application specific TLS coding. An example of this can be shown by setting the protocol within a line of code in your .Net 4.5 application: ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol = SecurityProtocolType.Tls12. This can override the O/S setting if the DisabledByDefault key is present. “DisabledByDefault” is useful in the case when you want to have some control over the system settings but also allow an application to explicitly specify the protocols they would like to use.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Enabled only works strongly in the negative case (“Enabled = 0”). If “Enabled=1” or is not set, then “DisabledByDefault” will override in the case where the application takes the system defaults. “Enabled=1” is also overridden by application specific protocol flags.</xhtml:p>
