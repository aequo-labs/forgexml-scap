This document provides prescriptive guidance for establishing a secure configuration posture for Microsoft Windows Operating Systems (OS).
This secure configuration guide is based on Windows 10 and is intended for all releases of the Windows 10 operating system, including older versions. This secure configuration guide was tested against       <xhtml:strong>Microsoft Windows 10 Release 22H2 Enterprise</xhtml:strong>
 edition.    </xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p>
Ensure that the latest version of this benchmark is downloaded, as it contains new and updated policies that are released by Microsoft. This benchmark follows the CIS on-prem Windows OS Benchmarks as closely as possible. Microsoft is continually updating Intune to support settings that are backed by Group Policy. Note that this benchmark is based off settings that were available and apply without known issues to MDM systems via       <xhtml:strong>Intune configuration profiles</xhtml:strong>
 at the       <xhtml:strong>time of publication</xhtml:strong>
.    </xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:strong>Note:</xhtml:strong>
 If       <xhtml:strong>Windows Autopilot</xhtml:strong>
 is used in the environment, a number of settings (search for Autopilot) need to be set exclusively to       <xhtml:strong>user groups</xhtml:strong>
 rather than device groups. This ensures the setting is applied later during enrollment, allowing Windows Autopilot to complete its pre-provisioning process and prevent potential interruptions.

   <xccdf:notice id="terms-of-use" xml:lang="en">	BACKGROUND.
	The Center for Internet Security ("CIS") provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to Internet users worldwide.	Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally generic in nature.	The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and devices.	Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to specific user requirements.	The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick fix" for anyone's information security needs.
	NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS.
	CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of	the Products or the Recommendations.	CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is" and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind.	USER AGREEMENTS.
	By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We") agree and acknowledge that:
	1.	No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component can be made fully secure;
	2.	We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our own risk;
	3.	We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from 		CIS's negligence or failure to perform; 
	4.	We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the 			Recommendations to our particular circumstances and requirements;
	5.	Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below) has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify us of 		the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and
	6.	Neither CIS nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise) for 		any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or damage 		to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, 	business interruption, wasted management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties) arising out of or in any way 	Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such 	damages), including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, 	viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other harmful items.
	GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS.
	CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use:
	1.	Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and 	use each of the Products on a single computer;
	2.	Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided 		that all such copies are printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed Terms of Use in its entirety.
	RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTION.
	The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and by international treaties.	We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties.	CIS reserves all rights not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights."
	Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute, encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device, without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi) use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product.	We will not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed in this paragraph.
	We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers, directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates, licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim.	We further agree that all CIS Parties are third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use.	SPECIAL RULES.
	CIS has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship.	Those special rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are covered by the special rules.
	CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization, whether by manual or electronic means.	Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time.
	CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION; VENUE.
	We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.	If any of these Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
	BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN ALL RESPECTS.</xccdf:notice>

Some legacy OSes (e.g. Windows XP, Server 2003 or older), applications and appliances may no longer be able to communicate with the system once SMBv1 is disabled. We recommend careful testing be performed to determine the impact prior to configuring this as a widespread control, and where possible, remediate any incompatibilities found with the vendor of the incompatible system. Microsoft is also maintaining a thorough (although not comprehensive) list of known SMBv1 incompatibilities at this link:                   <xhtml:a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/filecab/2017/06/01/smb1-product-clearinghouse/">SMB1 Product Clearinghouse | Storage at Microsoft</xhtml:a>

Some legacy OSes (e.g. Windows XP, Server 2003 or older), applications and appliances may no longer be able to communicate with the system once SMBv1 is disabled. We recommend careful testing be performed to determine the impact prior to configuring this as a widespread control, and where possible, remediate any incompatibilities found with the vendor of the incompatible system.

In February 2015, Microsoft released a new control mechanism to mitigate a security risk in Group Policy as part of the               <xhtml:a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/MS15-011">MS15-011</xhtml:a>
 /               <xhtml:a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3000483">MSKB 3000483</xhtml:a>
 security update. This mechanism requires both the installation of the new security update and also the deployment of specific group policy settings to all computers on the domain from Windows Vista / Server 2008 (non-R2) or newer (the associated security patch to enable this feature was not released for Server 2003). A new group policy template (              <xhtml:span class="inline_block">NetworkProvider.admx/adml</xhtml:span>
) was also provided with the security update.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Once the new GPO template is in place, the following are the minimum requirements to remediate the Group Policy security risk:</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">\\*\NETLOGON RequireMutualAuthentication=1, RequireIntegrity=1, RequirePrivacy=1</xhtml:span>

                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">\\*\SYSVOL RequireMutualAuthentication=1, RequireIntegrity=1, RequirePrivacy=1</xhtml:span>
                  </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:strong>Note:</xhtml:strong>
 A reboot may be required after the setting is applied to a client machine to access the above paths.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>
Additional guidance on the deployment of this security setting is available from the Microsoft Premier Field Engineering (PFE) Platforms TechNet Blog here:               <xhtml:a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/core-infrastructure-and-security/guidance-on-deployment-of-ms15-011-and-ms15-014/ba-p/257759">Guidance on Deployment of MS15-011 and MS15-014</xhtml:a>

Consult the BitLocker Drive Encryption Deployment Guide on Microsoft TechNet for more information about adding Data Recovery Agents.</xhtml:p>

This means that you will not be able to specify which recovery option to use when you enable BitLocker, instead BitLocker recovery options for the drive are determined by the policy setting.</xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>In "Save BitLocker recovery information to Active Directory Domain Services" choose which BitLocker recovery information to store in AD DS for fixed data drives. If you select "Backup recovery password and key package", both the BitLocker recovery password and key package are stored in AD DS. Storing the key package supports recovering data from a drive that has been physically corrupted. If you select "Backup recovery password only", only the recovery password is stored in AD DS.</xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>Select the "Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for fixed data drives" check box if you want to prevent users from enabling BitLocker unless the computer is connected to the domain and the backup of BitLocker recovery information to AD DS succeeds.</xhtml:p>

When the USB key is inserted the access to the drive is authenticated and the drive is accessible.

                     <xhtml:p>On a computer with a compatible TPM, four types of authentication methods can be used at startup to provide added protection for encrypted data.

                              <xhtml:p>When event logs fill to capacity, they will stop recording information unless the retention method for each is set so that the computer will overwrite the oldest entries with the most recent ones. To mitigate the risk of loss of recent data, you can configure the retention method so that older events are overwritten as needed.</xhtml:p>
                              <xhtml:p>The consequence of this configuration is that older events will be removed from the logs. Attackers can take advantage of such a configuration, because they can generate a large number of extraneous events to overwrite any evidence of their attack. These risks can be somewhat reduced if you automate the archival and backup of event log data.</xhtml:p>
                              <xhtml:p>Ideally, all specifically monitored events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) or some other automated monitoring tool. Such a configuration is particularly important because an attacker who successfully compromises a server could clear the Security log. If all events are sent to a monitoring server, then you will be able to gather forensic information about the attacker's activities.</xhtml:p>

                              <xhtml:p>The consequence of this configuration is that older events will be removed from the logs. Attackers can take advantage of such a configuration, because they can generate a large number of extraneous events to overwrite any evidence of their attack. These risks can be somewhat reduced if you automate the archival and backup of event log data.</xhtml:p>
                              <xhtml:p>Ideally, all specifically monitored events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) or some other automated monitoring tool. Such a configuration is particularly important because an attacker who successfully compromises a server could clear the Security log. If all events are sent to a monitoring server, then you will be able to gather forensic information about the attacker's activities.</xhtml:p>

                              <xhtml:p>When event logs fill to capacity, they will stop recording information unless the retention method for each is set so that the computer will overwrite the oldest entries with the most recent ones. To mitigate the risk of loss of recent data, you can configure the retention method so that older events are overwritten as needed.</xhtml:p>
                              <xhtml:p>The consequence of this configuration is that older events will be removed from the logs. Attackers can take advantage of such a configuration, because they can generate a large number of extraneous events to overwrite any evidence of their attack. These risks can be somewhat reduced if you automate the archival and backup of event log data.</xhtml:p>
                              <xhtml:p>Ideally, all specifically monitored events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) or some other automated monitoring tool. Such a configuration is particularly important because an attacker who successfully compromises a server could clear the Security log. If all events are sent to a monitoring server, then you will be able to gather forensic information about the attacker's activities.</xhtml:p>

This policy setting allows you to join Microsoft Active Protection Service (MAPS), which Microsoft renamed to                 <xhtml:em>Windows Defender Antivirus Cloud Protection Service</xhtml:em>
 and then                 <xhtml:em>Microsoft Defender Antivirus Cloud Protection Service</xhtml:em>
. Microsoft MAPS / Microsoft Defender Antivirus Cloud Protection Service is the online community that helps you choose how to respond to potential threats. The community also helps stop the spread of new malicious software infections. You can choose to send basic or additional information about detected software. Additional information helps Microsoft create new definitions and help it to protect your computer.              </xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>Possible options are:</xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:ul>
                        <xhtml:li>(0x0) Disabled (default)</xhtml:li>

                        <xhtml:strong>Basic membership</xhtml:strong>
 will send basic information to Microsoft about software that has been detected including where the software came from the actions that you apply or that are applied automatically and whether the actions were successful.              </xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>
                        <xhtml:strong>Advanced membership</xhtml:strong>
 in addition to basic information will send more information to Microsoft about malicious software spyware and potentially unwanted software including the location of the software file names how the software operates and how it has impacted your computer.              </xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>

 By default, this setting will use a self-signed certificate for RDP connections.

 setting to instruct RDP to use a certificate from your PKI instead of a self-signed one. Note that the certificate template used for this purpose must have “Client Authentication” configured as an Intended Purpose. Note also that a valid, non-expired certificate using the specified template must already be installed on the workstation for it to work.                      </xhtml:p>

 Some third party two-factor authentication solutions (e.g. RSA Authentication Agent) can be negatively affected by this setting, as the SSL/TLS security layer will expect the user's Windows password upon initial connection attempt (before the RDP logon screen), and once successfully authenticated, pass the credential along to that Windows session on the RDP host (to complete the login). If a two-factor agent is present and expecting a different credential at the RDP logon screen, this initial connection may result in a failed logon attempt, and also effectively cause a “double logon” requirement for each and every new RDP session.                      </xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>This subcategory reports on the activities of the Internet Protocol security (IPsec) driver. Events for this subcategory include:</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>4960: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed an integrity check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a network issue or that packets are being modified in transit to this computer. Verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error might also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>4961: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a replay attack against this computer.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>4962: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. The inbound packet had too low a sequence number to ensure it was not a replay.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>4963: IPsec dropped an inbound clear text packet that should have been secured. This is usually due to the remote computer changing its IPsec policy without informing this computer. This could also be a spoofing attack attempt.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>4965: IPsec received a packet from a remote computer with an incorrect Security Parameter Index (SPI). This is usually caused by malfunctioning hardware that is corrupting packets. If these errors persist, verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error may also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations. In that case, if connectivity is not impeded, then these events can be ignored.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>5478: IPsec Services has started successfully.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>5479: IPsec Services has been shut down successfully. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>5480: IPsec Services failed to get the complete list of network interfaces on the computer. This poses a potential security risk because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters. Use the IP Security Monitor snap-in to diagnose the problem.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>5483: IPsec Services failed to initialize RPC server. IPsec Services could not be started.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>5484: IPsec Services has experienced a critical failure and has been shut down. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>5485: IPsec Services failed to process some IPsec filters on a plug-and-play event for network interfaces. This poses a potential security risk because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters.

            <xhtml:p>LSASS authenticates users who sign in on a Windows computer. Microsoft Defender Credential Guard in Windows normally prevents attempts to extract credentials from LSASS. Some organizations can't enable Credential Guard on all of their computers because of compatibility issues with custom smartcard drivers or other programs that load into the Local Security Authority (LSA). In these cases, attackers can use tools like Mimikatz to scrape cleartext passwords and NTLM hashes from LSASS.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:strong>Note:</xhtml:strong>
 Enabling this rule doesn't provide additional protection if you have LSA protection enabled since the ASR rule and LSA protection work similarly.

With Windows Defender Credential Guard enabled, the LSA process in the operating system talks to a new component called the isolated LSA process that stores and protects those secrets. Data stored by the isolated LSA process is protected using virtualization-based security and is not accessible to the rest of the operating system.</xhtml:p>

                     <xhtml:p>The major impact of this configuration is that users must create a new password every time they are required to change their old one. If users are required to change their passwords to new unique values, there is an increased risk of users who write their passwords somewhere so that they do not forget them. Another risk is that users may create passwords that change incrementally (for example, password01, password02, and so on) to facilitate memorization but make them easier to guess.</xhtml:p>

There are many different theories about how to determine the best password length for an organization, but perhaps "passphrase" is a better term than "password." In Microsoft Windows 2000 or newer, passphrases can be quite long and can include spaces. Therefore, a phrase such as "I want to drink a $5 milkshake" is a valid passphrase; it is a considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string of random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated about the proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially around password length. In enterprise environments, the ideal value for the Minimum password length setting is 14 characters, however you should adjust this value to meet your organization's business requirements.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>Users may have favorite passwords that they like to use because they are easy to remember and they believe that their password choice is secure from compromise. Unfortunately, passwords are compromised and if an attacker is targeting a specific individual's user account, with foreknowledge of data about that user, reuse of old passwords can cause a security breach. To address password reuse a combination of security settings is required. Using this policy setting with the Enforce password history setting prevents the easy reuse of old passwords. For example, if you configure the Enforce password history setting to ensure that users cannot reuse any of their last 12 passwords, they could change their password 13 times in a few minutes and reuse the password they started with, unless you also configure the Minimum password age setting to a number that is greater than 0. You must configure this policy setting to a number that is greater than 0 for the Enforce password history setting to be effective.</xhtml:p>

In fact, the default settings for Active Directory domains require complex passwords of at least seven characters. However, if users with the ability to create new accounts bypass your domain-based password policies, they could create accounts with blank passwords. For example, a user could build a stand-alone computer, create one or more accounts with blank passwords, and then join the computer to the domain. The local accounts with blank passwords would still function. Anyone who knows the name of one of these unprotected accounts could then use it to log on.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>Session hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who have access to the same network as the client or server to interrupt, end, or steal a session in progress. Attackers can potentially intercept and modify unsigned SMB packets and then modify the traffic and forward it so that the server might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the attacker could pose as the server or client after legitimate authentication and gain unauthorized access to data.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>SMB is the resource sharing protocol that is supported by many Windows operating systems. It is the basis of NetBIOS and many other protocols. SMB signatures authenticate both users and the servers that host the data. If either side fails the authentication process, data transmission will not take place.</xhtml:p>

                     <xhtml:p>The Microsoft network server will negotiate SMB packet signing as requested by the client. That is, if packet signing has been enabled on the client, packet signing will be negotiated.</xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>The Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows Server 2003, Windows XP Professional and Windows Vista implementations of the SMB file and print sharing protocol support mutual authentication, which prevents session hijacking attacks and supports message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is then verified by both the client and the server.</xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance, because each packet needs to be signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server that is performing multiple roles, such as a small business server that is serving as a Domain Controller, file server, print server, and application server performance may be substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned SMB communications, older applications and operating systems will not be able to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing, computers will be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks.</xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>
When SMB signing policies are enabled on Domain Controllers running Windows Server 2003 and member computers running Windows Vista SP1 or Windows Server 2008 group policy processing will fail. A hotfix is available from Microsoft that resolves this issue; see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 950876 for more details:                 <xhtml:a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/950876">Group Policy settings are not applied on member computers that are running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Vista SP1 when certain SMB signing policies are enabled</xhtml:a>

            <xhtml:p>This setting determines if online identities are able to authenticate to this computer.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>The Public Key Cryptography Based User-to-User (PKU2U) protocol introduced in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 is implemented as a security support provider (SSP). The SSP enables peer-to-peer authentication, particularly through the Windows 7 media and file sharing feature called HomeGroup, which permits sharing between computers that are not members of a domain.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>
With PKU2U, a new extension was introduced to the Negotiate authentication package,           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Spnego.dll</xhtml:span>
. In previous versions of Windows, Negotiate decided whether to use Kerberos or NTLM for authentication. The extension SSP for Negotiate,           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Negoexts.dll</xhtml:span>
, which is treated as an authentication protocol by Windows, supports Microsoft SSPs including PKU2U.        </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>
When computers are configured to accept authentication requests by using online IDs,           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Negoexts.dll</xhtml:span>
 calls the PKU2U SSP on the computer that is used to log on. The PKU2U SSP obtains a local certificate and exchanges the policy between the peer computers. When validated on the peer computer, the certificate within the metadata is sent to the logon peer for validation and associates the user's certificate to a security token and the logon process completes.        </xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>LAN Manager (LM) was a family of early Microsoft client/server software (predating Windows NT) that allowed users to link personal computers together on a single network. LM network capabilities included transparent file and print sharing, user security features, and network administration tools. In Active Directory domains, the Kerberos protocol is the default authentication protocol. However, if the Kerberos protocol is not negotiated for some reason, Active Directory will use LM, NTLM, or NTLMv2. LAN Manager authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2 (NTLMv2) variants, and is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows clients when they perform the following operations:</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>Join a domain</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>Authenticate between Active Directory forests</xhtml:li>

               <xhtml:li>Authenticate to computers that do not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, or Windows XP</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>Authenticate to computers that are not in the domain</xhtml:li>
            </xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:p>The Network security: LAN Manager authentication level setting determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice affects the level of authentication protocol used by clients, the level of session security negotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>Windows 2000 and Windows XP clients were configured by default to send LM and NTLM authentication responses (Windows 95-based and Windows 98-based clients only send LM). The default settings in OSes predating Windows Vista / Windows Server 2008 (non-R2) allowed all clients to authenticate with servers and use their resources. However, this meant that LM responses - the weakest form of authentication response - were sent over the network, and it was potentially possible for attackers to sniff that traffic to more easily reproduce the user's password.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>The Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems cannot use the Kerberos version 5 protocol for authentication. For this reason, in a Windows Server 2003 domain, these computers authenticate by default with both the LM and NTLM protocols for network authentication. You can enforce a more secure authentication protocol for Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT by using NTLMv2. For the logon process, NTLMv2 uses a secure channel to protect the authentication process. Even if you use NTLMv2 for older clients and servers, Windows-based clients and servers that are members of the domain will use the Kerberos authentication protocol to authenticate with Windows Server 2003 or newer Domain Controllers. For these reasons, it is strongly preferred to restrict the use of LM &amp; NTLM (non-v2) as much as possible.</xhtml:p>

 With this setting configured as recommended, the default error message displayed when a user attempts to perform an operation or run a program requiring privilege elevation (without Administrator rights) is "                <xhtml:em>This program will not run. This program is blocked by group policy. For more information, contact your system administrator.</xhtml:em>
" Some users who are not used to seeing this message may believe that the operation or program they attempted to run is specifically blocked by group policy, as that is what the message seems to imply. This message may therefore result in user questions as to why that specific operation/program is blocked, when in fact, the problem is that they need to perform the operation or run the program with an Administrative account (or "Run as Administrator" if it                 <xhtml:em>is</xhtml:em>
 already an Administrator account), and they are not doing that.              </xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>One of the risks that the User Account Control feature introduced with Windows Vista is trying to mitigate is that of malicious software running under elevated credentials without the user or administrator being aware of its activity. An attack vector for these programs was to discover the password of the account named "Administrator" because that user account was created for all installations of Windows. To address this risk, in Windows Vista or newer, the built-in Administrator account is now disabled by default. In a default installation of a new computer, accounts with administrative control over the computer are initially set up in one of two ways:</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:li>If the computer is not joined to a domain, the first user account you create has the equivalent permissions as a local administrator.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>If the computer is joined to a domain, no local administrator accounts are created. The Enterprise or Domain Administrator must log on to the computer and create one if a local administrator account is warranted.</xhtml:li>
            </xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:p>Once Windows is installed, the built-in Administrator account may be manually enabled, but we strongly recommend that this account remain disabled.</xhtml:p>

 If your organization relies on Windows Update, the minimum recommended setting is           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Required diagnostic data</xhtml:span>
. Because no Windows Update information is collected when diagnostic data is off, important information about update failures is not sent. Microsoft uses this information to fix the causes of those failures and improve the quality of updates.        </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>

 The           <xhtml:em>Configure diagnostic data opt-in settings user interface</xhtml:em>

 Enhanced diagnostic data setting is not available on Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022 and has been replaced with policies that can control the amount of optional diagnostic data that is sent.

            <xhtml:p>This is a legacy service - its sole purpose is to maintain a list of computers and their network shares in the environment (i.e. "Network Neighborhood"). If enabled, it generates a lot of unnecessary traffic, including "elections" to see who gets to be the "master browser". This noisy traffic could also aid malicious attackers in discovering online machines, because the service also allows anyone to "browse" for shared resources without any authentication. This service used to be running by default in older Windows versions (e.g. Windows XP), but today it only remains for backward compatibility for very old software that requires it.</xhtml:p>

 As of January 2024, despite its inclusion in Microsoft’s official documentation, using an OMI-URI to configure a Windows Service Startup Mode via a custom profile will lead to an error in Intune.

                  <xhtml:p>The recommended configuration can also be established via PowerShell by running the following cmdlet:</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>Users who can change the time on a computer could cause several problems. For example, time stamps on event log entries could be made inaccurate, time stamps on files and folders that are created or modified could be incorrect, and computers that belong to a domain may not be able to authenticate themselves or users who try to log on to the domain from them. Also, because the Kerberos authentication protocol requires that the requestor and authenticator have their clocks synchronized within an administrator-defined skew period, an attacker who changes a computer's time may cause that computer to be unable to obtain or grant Kerberos tickets.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>The risk from these types of events is mitigated on most Domain Controllers, Member Servers, and end-user computers because the Windows Time service automatically synchronizes time with Domain Controllers in the following ways:</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>All client desktop computers and Member Servers use the authenticating Domain Controller as their inbound time partner.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>All Domain Controllers in a domain nominate the Primary Domain Controller (PDC) Emulator operations master as their inbound time partner.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>All PDC Emulator operations masters follow the hierarchy of domains in the selection of their inbound time partner.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>The PDC Emulator operations master at the root of the domain is authoritative for the organization. Therefore it is recommended that you configure this computer to synchronize with a reliable external time server.</xhtml:li>
            </xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:p>This vulnerability becomes much more serious if an attacker is able to change the system time and then stop the Windows Time service or reconfigure it to synchronize with a time server that is not accurate.</xhtml:p>

         <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
            <xhtml:p>This policy setting determines which users can create symbolic links. In Windows Vista, existing NTFS file system objects, such as files and folders, can be accessed by referring to a new kind of file system object called a symbolic link. A symbolic link is a pointer (much like a shortcut or .lnk file) to another file system object, which can be a file, folder, shortcut or another symbolic link. The difference between a shortcut and a symbolic link is that a shortcut only works from within the Windows shell. To other programs and applications, shortcuts are just another file, whereas with symbolic links, the concept of a shortcut is implemented as a feature of the NTFS file system.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>
Symbolic links can potentially expose security vulnerabilities in applications that are not designed to use them. For this reason, the privilege for creating symbolic links should only be assigned to trusted users. By default, only           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Administrators</xhtml:span>
 can create symbolic links.        </xhtml:p>

 configure the setting           <xhtml:em>Do not allow update deferral policies to cause scans against Windows Update</xhtml:em>
 (added in the Windows 10 Release 1709 Administrative Templates) in order to prevent the Dual Scan feature from interfering. More information on Dual Scan is available at these links:        </xhtml:p>

 Starting with Windows 10 R1607, Microsoft introduced a new Windows Update (WU) client behavior called           <xhtml:strong>Dual Scan</xhtml:strong>
, with an eye to cloud-based update management. In some cases, this Dual Scan feature can interfere with Windows Updates from Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) and/or manual WU updates. If you are using WSUS in your environment, you may need to set the above setting to           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Not Configured</xhtml:span>
               <xhtml:em>or</xhtml:em>
 configure the setting           <xhtml:em>Do not allow update deferral policies to cause scans against Windows Update</xhtml:em>
 (added in the Windows 10 Release 1709 Administrative Templates) in order to prevent the Dual Scan feature from interfering. More information on Dual Scan is available at these links:        </xhtml:p>

 An organization wishing to use Active Directory to backup the LAPS password may make an exception for this recommendation. To implement Active Directory backup see the latest on-premises CIS Benchmark for Windows 10/11. When backing up with Active Directory there are 2 additional security controls to be considered in the benchmark which are not available when using Azure AD for backup. These were excluded from the Intune benchmark as they cannot be selected unless Active Directory is selected as the backup location.        </xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>This policy setting configures the Windows LAPS Password Settings policy for password complexity.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Each additional character in a password increases its complexity exponentially. For instance, a seven-character, all lower-case alphabetic password would have 26 to the power of 7 (approximately 8 x 10 to the power of 9 or 8 billion) possible combinations. At 1,000,000 attempts per second (a capability of many password-cracking utilities), it would only take 133 minutes to crack. A seven-character alphabetic password with case sensitivity has 52 to the power of 7 combinations. A seven-character case-sensitive alphanumeric password without punctuation has 627 combinations. An eight-character password has 26 to the power of 8 (or 2 x 10 to the power of 11) possible combinations. Although this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000 attempts per second it would take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords. Remember, these times will significantly increase for passwords that use ALT characters and other special keyboard characters such as "!" or "@". Proper use of the password settings can help make it difficult to mount a brute force attack.</xhtml:p>
