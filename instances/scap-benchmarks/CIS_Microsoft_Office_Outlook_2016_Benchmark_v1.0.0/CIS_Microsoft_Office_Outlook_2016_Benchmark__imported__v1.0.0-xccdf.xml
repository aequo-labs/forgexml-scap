   <xccdf:notice id="terms-of-use" xml:lang="en">	BACKGROUND.
	The Center for Internet Security ("CIS") provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to Internet users worldwide.	Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally generic in nature.	The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and devices.	Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to specific user requirements.	The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick fix" for anyone's information security needs.
	NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS.
	CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of	the Products or the Recommendations.	CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is" and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind.	USER AGREEMENTS.
	By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We") agree and acknowledge that:
	1.	No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component can be made fully secure;
	2.	We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our own risk;
	3.	We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from 		CIS's negligence or failure to perform; 
	4.	We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the 			Recommendations to our particular circumstances and requirements;
	5.	Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below) has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify us of 		the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and
	6.	Neither CIS nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise) for 		any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or damage 		to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, 	business interruption, wasted management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties) arising out of or in any way 	Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such 	damages), including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, 	viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other harmful items.
	GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS.
	CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use:
	1.	Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and 	use each of the Products on a single computer;
	2.	Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided 		that all such copies are printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed Terms of Use in its entirety.
	RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTION.
	The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and by international treaties.	We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties.	CIS reserves all rights not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights."
	Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute, encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device, without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi) use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product.	We will not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed in this paragraph.
	We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers, directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates, licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim.	We further agree that all CIS Parties are third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use.	SPECIAL RULES.
	CIS has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship.	Those special rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are covered by the special rules.
	CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization, whether by manual or electronic means.	Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time.
	CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION; VENUE.
	We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.	If any of these Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
	BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN ALL RESPECTS.</xccdf:notice>

This policy setting controls which authentication method Outlook uses to authenticate with Microsoft Exchange Server. Note - Exchange Server supports the Kerberos authentication protocol and NTLM for authentication. The Kerberos protocol is the more secure authentication method and is supported on Windows 2000 Server and later versions. NTLM authentication is supported in pre-Windows 2000 environments. If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from three different options for controlling how Outlook authenticates with Microsoft Exchange Server: - Kerberos/NTLM password authentication. Outlook attempts to authenticate using the Kerberos authentication protocol. If this attempt fails, Outlook attempts to authenticate using NTLM. This option is the default configuration. - Kerberos password authentication. Outlook attempts to authenticate using the Kerberos protocol only. - NTLM password authentication. Outlook attempts to authenticate using NTLM only. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Outlook will attempt to authenticate using the Kerberos authentication protocol. If it cannot (because no Windows 2000 or later domain controllers are available), it will authenticate using NTLM. The recommended state for this setting is:               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Enabled:Kerberos/NTLM Password Authentication</xhtml:span>

This policy setting controls whether Outlook subscribes to the Common Feed List, which is made available to multiple RSS clients. The Common Feed List is a hierarchical set of RSS Feeds to which clients such as Outlook, the Feeds list in Internet Explorer 7, and the Feed Headlines Sidebar gadget in Windows Vista can subscribe. If you enable this policy setting, Outlook automatically subscribes to RSS Feeds added in Internet Explorer, and Outlook RSS Feeds are synchronized with the Common Feed List so they are available in Internet Explorer. Be aware that third-party applications besides Internet Explorer can add RSS Feeds to the Common Feed List, and if you enable this setting Outlook automatically subscribes to those RSS Feeds as well. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Outlook maintains its own list of RSS Feeds and does not automatically subscribe to RSS Feeds that are added to the Common Feed List. The recommended state for this setting is:               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Disabled</xhtml:span>

This policy setting allows you to control how plain text messages are formatted when they are sent from Outlook. If you enable this policy setting, text is automatically wrapped in Internet e-mail messages and attachments are encoded in UUENCODE format. If you disable this policy setting, Outlook uses the standard MIME format to encode attachments in plain text Outlook messages. Users will not be able to change this configuration. If you do not configure this policy setting, the behavior is the equivalent of setting the policy to Disabled, but users can modify plain text options in Outlook when required by clicking Tools, clicking Options, clicking the Mail Format tab, clicking Internet Format, and changing the values under "Plain text options". The recommended state for this setting is:                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Disabled</xhtml:span>

                     <xhtml:p>If outgoing mail is formatted in certain ways, for example if attachments are encoded in UUENCODE format, attackers might manipulate the messages for their own purposes. If UUENCODE formatting is used, an attacker could manipulate the encoded attachment to bypass content filtering software. By default, Outlook automatically wraps plain text messages at 76 characters and uses the standard MIME format to encode attachments in plain text messages. However, these settings can be altered to allow e-mail to be read in plain text e-mail programs that use a non-standard line length or that cannot process MIME attachments.</xhtml:p>

                     <xhtml:p>Outlook 2016 allows users to designate Web pages as home pages for personal or public folders. When a user clicks on a folder, Outlook displays the home page the user has assigned to it. Although this feature provides the opportunity to create powerful public folder applications, scripts can be included on Web pages that access the Outlook object model, which exposes users to security risks. By default, Outlook does not allow users to define folder home pages for folders in non-default stores. If this configuration is changed, users can create and access dangerous folder home pages for Outlook data files (.pst) and other non-default stores, which can compromise the security of the users' data.</xhtml:p>

This policy setting controls whether e-mail messages dragged from Outlook to the file system are saved in Unicode or ANSI format. If you enable this policy setting, when users drag an e-mail message from Outlook to the file system, Outlook uses the Unicode character encoding standard to create the message file, which preserves special characters in the message. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, when users drag an e-mail message from Outlook to the file system, the message file created is in ANSI format.

                     <xhtml:p>By default, when users drag e-mail messages from Outlook to a Windows Explorer window or to their Desktop, Outlook creates a .msg file using the native character encoding format for the configured locale (the so-called "ANSI" format). If this setting is Enabled, Outlook uses the Unicode character encoding standard to create the message file, which preserves special characters in the message. However, Unicode text is vulnerable to homograph attacks, in which characters are replaced by different but similar-looking characters. For example, the Cyrillic letter ? (U+0430) appears identical to the Latin letter a (U+0061) in many typefaces, but is actually a different character. Homographs can be used in "phishing" attacks to convince victims to visit fraudulent Web sites and enter sensitive information.</xhtml:p>

This policy setting determines what restrictions apply to users who publish their calendars on Office.com or third-party World Wide Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) servers. If you enable or disable this policy setting, calendars that are published on Office.com must have restricted access (users other than the calendar owner/publisher who wish to view the calendar can only do so if they receive invitations from the calendar owner), and users cannot publish their calendars to third-party DAV servers. If you do not configure this policy setting, users can share their calendars with others by publishing them to the Office.com Calendar Sharing Services and to a server that supports the World Wide Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) protocol. Office.com allows users to choose whether to restrict access to their calendars to people they invite, or allow unrestricted access to anyone who knows the URL to reach the calendar. DAV access restrictions can only be achieved through server and folder permissions, and might require the assistance of a server administrator to set up and maintain. The recommended state for this setting is:                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Enabled</xhtml:span>

This policy setting controls whether Outlook can automatically upload calendar updates to Office.com. If you enable this policy setting, Outlook enforces the "Single Upload: Updates will not be uploaded from the Published Calendar Settings dialog" option, and calendar updates are not uploaded. Users will not be able to change this setting. If you disable this policy setting Outlook automatically publishes calendar updates to Office.com at regular intervals and users will not be able to change this. If you do not configure this policy setting, when users publish their calendar to Office.com using the Microsoft Outlook Calendar Sharing Service, Outlook updates the calendars online at regular intervals unless they click "Advanced" and select "Single Upload: Updates will not be uploaded from the Published Calendar Settings dialog".

This policy setting controls whether recipients' e-mail addresses are automatically added to the user's Safe Senders List in Microsoft Outlook. Sometimes users will send e-mail messages to request that they be taken off a mailing list. If the e-mail recipient is then automatically added to the Safe Senders List, future e-mail messages from that address will no longer be sent to the users Junk E-mail folder, even if it would otherwise be considered junk. If you enable this policy setting, all recipients of outgoing messages are automatically added to users' Safe Senders Lists. If users respond to junk e-mail senders while this policy setting is Enabled, all future junk e-mail from the same address will be considered safe.

This policy setting controls whether the Junk E-mail Filter is enabled in Outlook. The Junk E-mail Filter in Outlook is designed to intercept the most obvious junk e-mail, or spam, and send it to users' Junk E-mail folders. The filter evaluates each incoming message based on several factors, including the time when the message was sent and the content of the message. The filter does not single out any particular sender or message type, but instead analyzes each message based on its content and structure to discover whether or not it is probably spam. If you enable this policy setting, junk e-mail filtering in Outlook is turned off entirely, in addition to hiding the filtering controls from users. In addition, you can use the "Junk E-mail Protection level" policy setting to preset a filtering level and prevent users from changing it. Note - This policy setting does not affect the configuration of the Microsoft Exchange Server Intelligent Message Filter (IMF), which provides server-level junk e-mail filtering. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the Junk E-mail Filter in Outlook is enabled.

This policy setting controls your Junk E-mail protection level. The Junk E-mail Filter in Outlook helps to prevent junk e-mail messages, also known as spam, from cluttering user's Inbox. The filter evaluates each incoming message based on several factors, including the time when the message was sent and the content of the message. The filter does not single out any particular sender or message type, but instead analyzes each message based on its content and structure to discover whether or not it is probably spam. If you enable this policy setting, you can select one of the four listed options available. After you select an option, users will not be able to change it. If you disable this policy setting, Outlook reverts to the user-defined protection level. If you do not configure this policy setting, users can change their junk e-mail filtering options.

However, because this configuration could block desirable content from display, Outlook can also be configured to automatically display external content in any messages sent by people who are listed in users' Safe Senders Lists or Safe Recipients Lists. By default, Outlook automatically displays external content in e-mail messages from people listed in users' Safe Senders Lists or Safe Recipients Lists, and automatically blocks external content in other messages.

                     <xhtml:p>Cryptographic errors in Outlook are classified as Level 1 (serious errors) or Level 2 (not as serious).

Key sizes are measured in bits, with larger keys generally less vulnerable to attack than smaller ones. 40-bit and 56-bit keys were common in the past, but as computers have become faster and more powerful these smaller key sizes have become vulnerable to brute-force attacks in which the attacking computer rapidly runs through every possible key combination until it successfully decrypts the message. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) published by the United States government requires a minimum key size of 128 bits for symmetric encryption, which offers significantly more protection against brute-force attack than smaller key sizes.</xhtml:p>

This policy setting controls whether Outlook users can demote attachments to Level 2 by using a registry key, which will allow them to save files to disk and open them from that location. Outlook uses two levels of security to restrict access to files attached to e-mail messages or other items. Files with specific extensions can be categorized as Level 1 (users cannot view the file) or Level 2 (users can open the file after saving it to disk). Users can freely open files of types that are not categorized as Level 1 or Level 2. If you enable this policy setting, users can create a list of Level 1 file types to demote to Level 2 by adding the file types to the following registry key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Outlook\Security\Level1Remove. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, users cannot demote level 1 attachments to level 2, and the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Outlook\Security\Level1Remove registry key has no effect.

This policy setting controls whether Outlook displays a warning before closing an item that contains an unsafe attachment that will be blocked when the item is re-opened.

(See Attachment file types restricted by Outlook for the complete list.) Outlook does not classify any file types as Level 2 by default, so this setting is not particularly useful in isolation. Typically, if there are extensions on the Level 2 list they would have been added by using the "Add file extensions to block as Level 2" setting, through which they can be removed. The combined lists of blocked and restricted file extensions that Outlook uses are actually built by combining various policies together. If a machine policy classifies an extension as Level 2, this setting could be used to remove the extension from the list in some situations. As with Level 1 extensions, though, removing restrictions on potentially dangerous extensions can make it easier for users to open dangerous files, which can significantly reduce security.</xhtml:p>

                     <xhtml:p>This policy setting controls whether Outlook prompts users before executing a custom action. Custom actions add functionality to Outlook that can be triggered as part of a rule. Among other possible features, custom actions can be created that reply to messages in ways that circumvent the Outlook model's programmatic send protections. If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from four options to control how Outlook functions when a custom action is executed that uses the Outlook object model:</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>* Outlook Default Security - This option is the default configuration in Outlook. Users can configure security themselves, and Outlook ignores any security-related settings configured in Group Policy.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>* Use Security Form from 'Outlook Security Settings' Public Folder - Outlook uses the settings from the security form published in the designated public folder.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>* Use Outlook Security Group Policy - Outlook uses security settings from Group Policy.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Important - You must enable this policy setting if you want to apply the other Outlook security policy settings mentioned in this guide.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Outlook users can configure security for themselves, and Outlook ignores any security-related settings that are configured in Group Policy.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>
Note - In previous versions of Outlook, when security settings were published in a form in Exchange Server public folders, users who needed these settings required the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Security\CheckAdminSettings registry key to be set on their computers for the settings to apply. In Outlook, the CheckAdminSettings registry key is no longer used to determine users' security settings. Instead, the Outlook Security Mode setting can be used to determine whether Outlook security should be controlled directly by Group Policy, by the security form from the Outlook Security Settings Public Folder, or by the settings on users' own computers The recommended state for this setting is:               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Enabled:Use Outlook Security Group Policy</xhtml:span>

Outlook disables all macros that are not opened from a trusted location, even if the macros are signed by a trusted publisher.

                     <xhtml:li>
Warning for signed, disable unsigned. This option corresponds to the "Warnings for signed macros; all unsigned macros are disabled" option in the Trust Center. Outlook handles macros as follows:
                <xhtml:ul>
                           <xhtml:li>If a macro is digitally signed by a trusted publisher, the macro can run if the user has already trusted the publisher.</xhtml:li>
                           <xhtml:li>If a macro has a valid signature from a publisher that the user has not trusted, the security alert dialog box for the macro lets the user choose whether to enable the macro for the current session, disable the macro for the current session, or to add the publisher to the Trusted Publishers list so that it will run without prompting the user in the future.</xhtml:li>
                           <xhtml:li>If a macro does not have a valid signature, Outlook disables it without prompting the user, unless it is opened from a trusted location.</xhtml:li>

                  <xhtml:ul>
                     <xhtml:li>No security check. This option corresponds to the "No security check for macros (Not recommended)" option in the Trust Center.
