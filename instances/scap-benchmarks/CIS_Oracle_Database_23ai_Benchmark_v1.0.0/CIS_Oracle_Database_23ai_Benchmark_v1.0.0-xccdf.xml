   <xccdf:notice id="terms-of-use" xml:lang="en">	BACKGROUND.
	The Center for Internet Security ("CIS") provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to Internet users worldwide.	Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally generic in nature.	The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and devices.	Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to specific user requirements.	The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick fix" for anyone's information security needs.
	NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS.
	CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of	the Products or the Recommendations.	CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is" and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind.	USER AGREEMENTS.
	By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We") agree and acknowledge that:
	1.	No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component can be made fully secure;
	2.	We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our own risk;
	3.	We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from 		CIS's negligence or failure to perform; 
	4.	We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the 			Recommendations to our particular circumstances and requirements;
	5.	Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below) has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify us of 		the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and
	6.	Neither CIS nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise) for 		any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or damage 		to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, 	business interruption, wasted management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties) arising out of or in any way 	Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such 	damages), including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, 	viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other harmful items.
	GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS.
	CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use:
	1.	Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and 	use each of the Products on a single computer;
	2.	Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided 		that all such copies are printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed Terms of Use in its entirety.
	RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTION.
	The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and by international treaties.	We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties.	CIS reserves all rights not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights."
	Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute, encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device, without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi) use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product.	We will not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed in this paragraph.
	We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers, directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates, licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim.	We further agree that all CIS Parties are third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use.	SPECIAL RULES.
	CIS has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship.	Those special rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are covered by the special rules.
	CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization, whether by manual or electronic means.	Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time.
	CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION; VENUE.
	We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.	If any of these Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
	BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN ALL RESPECTS.</xccdf:notice>

The restrictions on Client/User connections to the Oracle database help block unauthorized access to data and services by setting access rules. These security measures help to ensure that successful logins cannot be easily made through brute-force password attacks or intuited by clever social engineering exploits. Settings are generally recommended to be applied to all defined profiles rather than by using only the         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">DEFAULT</xhtml:span>
 profile. All values assigned below are the recommended minimums or maximums; higher, more restrictive values can be applied at the discretion of the organization by creating a separate profile to assign to a different user group.      </xhtml:p>

The           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS</xhtml:span>

            <xhtml:p>Organizations may choose a higher value for specific use cases, such as application data source accounts, to prevent unnecessary lockouts while maintaining security. However, increasing this threshold should be carefully reviewed to ensure that the system's security posture is maintained and accounts are protected against unauthorized or brute-force login attempts.</xhtml:p>

      <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
         <xhtml:p>The ability to audit database activity is one of the most important security features of databases. Decisions need to be made about the scope of the audit, as the audit incurs costs - for the storage of the audit log and for the performance impact on the audited operations - and perhaps even for the database or system in general. Then there are the additional costs of managing (storing, backing up, securing) and reviewing the data in the audit trail.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>Enabling auditing in an Oracle database may introduce performance overhead, particularly in high-transaction environments. Depending on the volume of audited activities, it can lead to increased storage usage, slower query execution, and potential contention for system resources. In extreme cases, improper audit configurations may contribute to database instability or unexpected service disruptions.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>Before enabling auditing, it is strongly recommended to perform thorough testing in a non-production environment, ensure sufficient storage allocation, and monitor performance impact. Additionally, review Oracle’s documentation and best practices to implement auditing in a controlled and efficient manner.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>This section deals with Oracle Unified Auditing, as from Oracle 23ai only this type of auditing is supported by Oracle.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>If the Oracle database was upgraded from Oracle 19c to Oracle 23ai, traditional auditing can still exist, but no new audit rules can be added.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>There are 2 types of policies under Oracle Unified Auditing:</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:li>Common Audit Policies</xhtml:li>
            <xhtml:li>Local Audit Policies</xhtml:li>
         </xhtml:ul>
         <xhtml:p>
The Common Audit Policy in the CDB is defined with the option         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">CONTAINER=ALL</xhtml:span>
 and applies automatically in the CDB and all PDBs. A common audit policy applies to all containers. When you create a common audit policy, prefix the name with         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">C##</xhtml:span>
 or         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">c##</xhtml:span>
 (for example,         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">c##all_select_pol</xhtml:span>
). This policy can only contain actions, system privileges, common roles, and common objects. You can apply a common audit policy only to common users. Attempts to enforce a common audit policy for a local user across all containers result in an error.      </xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>Local audit policies must be installed in the CDB as well as in each PDB and then apply to all types of database users (local and common). A local audit policy applies to a single PDB. You can enforce local audit policies for local and common users in this PDB only. Attempts to enforce local audit policies across all containers result in an error.
In order to log all user activities, a local audit policy must therefore be installed in the CDB and each PDB.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>Depending on the application purpose, the unified audit trail can either be read in each PDB or the common unified audit trail of all PDBs and the CDB together from the CDB.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>As of 23ai, audit data can be collected from the following sources with corresponding Oracle Unified Audit Policies:</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:li>Audit records (including SYS* audit records) from unified audit policies and AUDIT settings</xhtml:li>
            <xhtml:li>
Fine-grained audit records from the           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">DBMS_FGA PL/SQL</xhtml:span>

            <xhtml:li>Oracle Recovery Manager audit records</xhtml:li>
            <xhtml:li>Oracle Database Vault audit records</xhtml:li>

            <xhtml:p>Auditing critical packages in Oracle is essential to ensure database security, maintain accountability, and support compliance with regulatory requirements.

            <xhtml:p>Auditing these critical packages is recommended; however, it should be enabled based on the specific needs and requirements of the organization:</xhtml:p>

) privileges should always be audited.        </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>
Under Oracle classic auditing, this was the case with the parameter           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">AUDIT_SYS_OPERATIONS = TRUE</xhtml:span>
. To achieve the same behavior with Unified Auditing, it is necessary to audit all users who use           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">SYS*</xhtml:span>
 privileges.        </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>
As the           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">SYS*</xhtml:span>
 privileges have the special feature of being used first, it is necessary to audit them separately, as otherwise they will not be taken into account by the other audit policies.        </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>
Example:
A user with           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">SYSDBA</xhtml:span>
 privileges accesses a table (e.g.           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">HR.EMP</xhtml:span>
). In this case, not the           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">SELECT ANY TABLE</xhtml:span>
 privilege, but the           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">SYSDBA</xhtml:span>
 privilege is used. As a result, audit rule 5.1 does not fire.        </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>With unified auditing, it must always be ensured that the privileges are used for object access in the following order (if available):</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ol>
               <xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:span class="inline_block">SYS*</xhtml:span>
 privileges (e.g.             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">SYSDBA)</xhtml:span>

The capability to use database resources at a given level, or user authorization rules, allows for user manipulation of the various parts of the Oracle database. These authorizations must be structured to block unauthorized use and/or corruption of vital data and services by setting restrictions on user capabilities, particularly those of the user         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">PUBLIC</xhtml:span>

 Use caution when revoking privileges from         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">PUBLIC</xhtml:span>

Please see the following Oracle support document which provides further information and SQL statements that can be used to determine dependencies that require explicit grants: Be Cautious When Revoking Privileges Granted to         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">PUBLIC</xhtml:span>

         <xhtml:p>
This document has been authored with the expectation that a user with appropriate permissions will be used to execute the queries and perform other assessment actions. While this could be accomplished by granting         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">DBA</xhtml:span>
 privileges to a given user, the preferred approach is to create a dedicated user and grant only the specific permissions required to perform the assessments expressed herein. Doing this avoids the necessity for any user assessing the system to be granted         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">DBA</xhtml:span>
 privileges.      </xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>
The recommendations expressed in this document assume the presence of a common role named         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">C##CISSCANROLE</xhtml:span>
 and a common user named         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">C##CISSCAN</xhtml:span>

 Different organizations may wish to follow the instructions in this appendix in different ways. For more permanent or regular assessment scans, it may be acceptable to retain the         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">CISSCANROLE</xhtml:span>
 and         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">CISSCAN</xhtml:span>

 role and         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">CISSCAN</xhtml:span>
 user may be dropped. Such a decision is ultimately left up to the implementing organization.      </xhtml:p>
