         <xccdf:notice id="terms-of-use" xml:lang="en">	BACKGROUND.
	The Center for Internet Security ("CIS") provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to Internet users worldwide.	Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally generic in nature.	The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and devices.	Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to specific user requirements.	The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick fix" for anyone's information security needs.
	NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS.
	CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of	the Products or the Recommendations.	CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is" and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind.	USER AGREEMENTS.
	By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We") agree and acknowledge that:
	1.	No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component can be made fully secure;
	2.	We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our own risk;
	3.	We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from 		CIS's negligence or failure to perform; 
	4.	We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the 			Recommendations to our particular circumstances and requirements;
	5.	Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below) has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify us of 		the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and
	6.	Neither CIS nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise) for 		any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or damage 		to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, 	business interruption, wasted management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties) arising out of or in any way 	Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such 	damages), including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, 	viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other harmful items.
	GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS.
	CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use:
	1.	Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and 	use each of the Products on a single computer;
	2.	Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided 		that all such copies are printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed Terms of Use in its entirety.
	RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTION.
	The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and by international treaties.	We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties.	CIS reserves all rights not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights."
	Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute, encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device, without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi) use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product.	We will not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed in this paragraph.
	We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers, directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates, licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim.	We further agree that all CIS Parties are third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use.	SPECIAL RULES.
	CIS has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship.	Those special rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are covered by the special rules.
	CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization, whether by manual or electronic means.	Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time.
	CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION; VENUE.
	We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.	If any of these Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
	BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN ALL RESPECTS.</xccdf:notice>

                  <xhtml:p>It's an unfortunate reality that Linux distributions do not always have the most up-to-date versions of PostgreSQL. Disadvantages of older releases include: missing bug patches, no access to highly desirable contribution modules, no access to 3rd party projects that are complimentary to PostgreSQL, and no upgrade path migrating from one version of PostgreSQL to the next. The worst set of circumstances is to be limited to a version of the RDBMS that has reached its end-of-life.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>


From a security perspective, it's imperative that Postgres Community Packages are only obtained from the official website                                   <xhtml:a href="https://yum.postgresql.org/">https://yum.postgresql.org/</xhtml:a>


. Being open source, the Postgres packages are widely available over the internet via myriad package aggregators and providers. Obtaining software from these unofficial sites risks installing defective, corrupt, or downright malicious versions of PostgreSQL.                            </xhtml:p>

 is where all adjustable parameters can be set. A configuration file is created as part of the data cluster's creation i.e.                                         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">initdb</xhtml:span>


. The configuration file enumerates all tunable parameters and even though most of them are commented out it is understood that they are in fact active and at those very same documented values. The reason that they are commented out is to signify their default values. Uncommenting them will force the server to read these values instead of using the default values.                                  </xhtml:p>

Basic statement logging can be provided by the standard logging facility with                                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">log_statement = all</xhtml:span>


. This is acceptable for monitoring and other uses but does not provide the level of detail generally required for an audit. It is not enough to have a list of all the operations performed against the database, it must also be possible to find particular statements that are of interest to an auditor. The standard logging facility shows what the user requested, while pgAudit focuses on the details of what happened while the database was satisfying the request.                            </xhtml:p>

 statements, pgAudit can be configured to log a separate entry for each relation referenced in a statement. No parsing is required to find all statements that touch a particular table. In fact, the goal is that the statement text is provided primarily for deep forensics and should not be required for an audit.                            </xhtml:p>

It is common to have more than one authorized individual administering the PostgreSQL service at the Operating System level. It is also quite common to permit login privileges to individuals on a PostgreSQL host who otherwise are not authorized to access the server's data cluster and files. Administering the PostgreSQL data cluster, as opposed to its data, is to be accomplished via a localhost login of a regular UNIX user account.

                  <xhtml:p>With respect to PostgreSQL administrative SQL commands, only superusers should have elevated privileges. PostgreSQL regular, or application, users should not possess the ability to create roles, create new databases, manage replication, or perform any other action deemed privileged. Typically, regular users should only be granted the minimal set of privileges commensurate with managing the application:</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>Further, it has become best practice to create separate roles for DDL and DML. Given an application called 'payroll', one would create the following users:</xhtml:p>

                     <xhtml:li>payroll_owner</xhtml:li>

                  <xhtml:p>Any DDL privileges would be granted to the 'payroll_owner' account only, while DML privileges would be given to the 'payroll_user' account only. This prevents accidental creation/altering/dropping of database objects by application code that run as the 'payroll_user' account.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>In certain situations, to provide required functionality, PostgreSQL needs to execute internal logic (stored procedures, functions, triggers, etc.) and/or external code modules with elevated privileges. However, if the privileges required for execution are at a higher level than the privileges assigned to organizational users invoking the functionality applications/programs, those users are indirectly provided with greater privileges than assigned by their organization. This is known as privilege elevation. Privilege elevation must be utilized only where necessary. Execute privileges for application functions should be restricted to authorized users only.</xhtml:p>

, tables can have row security policies that restrict, on a per-user basis, which individual rows can be returned by normal queries or inserted, updated, or deleted by data modification commands. This feature is also known as Row Level Security (RLS).                            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>


By default, tables do not have any policies, so if a user has access privileges to a table according to the SQL privilege system, all rows within it are equally available for querying or updating. Row security policies can be specific to commands, to roles, or to both. A policy can be specified to apply to                                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ALL</xhtml:span>

Even when reducing and limiting the access to the superuser role as described earlier in this benchmark, it is still difficult to determine who accessed the superuser role and what actions were taken using that role. As such, it is ideal to prevent anyone from logging in as the superuser and forcing them to escalate their role. This model is used at the OS level by the use of                                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">sudo</xhtml:span>

               <xhtml:p>


Settings are generally recommended to be applied to all defined profiles. The following presents standalone examples of logins for particular use cases. The authentication rules are read from the PostgreSQL host-based authentication file,                             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">pg_hba.conf</xhtml:span>


, from top to bottom. The first rule conforming to the condition of the request executes the METHOD                             <xhtml:em>and stops further processing of the file</xhtml:em>


. Incorrectly applied rules, as defined by a single line instruction, can substantially alter the intended behavior resulting in either allowing or denying login attempts.                      </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>It is strongly recommended that authentication configurations be constructed incrementally with rigid testing for each newly applied rule. Because of the large number of different variations, this benchmark limits itself to a small number of authentication methods that can be successfully applied under most circumstances. Further analysis, using the other authentication methods available in PostgreSQL, is encouraged.</xhtml:p>

A remote host login, via ssh, is arguably the most secure means of remotely accessing and administering the PostgreSQL server. Connecting with the                                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">psql</xhtml:span>

 authentication method is the most secure mechanism available for local connections. Provided a database user account of the same name of the UNIX account has already been defined in the database, even ordinary user accounts can access the cluster in a similarly highly secure manner.                            </xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>PostgreSQL handling data that requires "data at rest" protections must employ cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification of the information at rest. These cryptographic mechanisms may be native to PostgreSQL or implemented via additional software or operating system/file system settings, as appropriate to the situation. Information at rest refers to the state of information when it is located on a secondary storage device (e.g. disk drive, tape drive) within an organizational information system.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Selection of a cryptographic mechanism is based on the need to protect the integrity of organizational information. The strength of the mechanism is commensurate with the security category and/or classification of the information. Organizations have the flexibility to either encrypt all information on storage devices (i.e. full disk encryption) or encrypt specific data structures (e.g. files, records, or fields). Organizations may also optionally choose to implement both to implement layered security.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>The decision whether, and what, to encrypt rests with the data owner and is also influenced by the physical measures taken to secure the equipment and media on which the information resides. Organizations may choose to employ different mechanisms to achieve confidentiality and integrity protections, as appropriate. If the confidentiality and integrity of application data is not protected, the data will be open to compromise and unauthorized modification.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>Data redundancy often plays a major role as part of an overall database strategy. Replication is an example of data redundancy and fulfills both High Availability and High Performance requirements. However, although the DBA may have expended much time and effort securing the PRIMARY host and taken the time to harden STANDBY configuration parameters, one sometimes overlooks the medium transmitting the data itself over the network. Consequently, replication is an appealing attack vector given that all DDL, and DML operations executed on the PRIMARY, or master, host is sent over the wire to the SECONDARY/STANDBY, or slave, hosts. Fortunately, when correctly understood, defeating such attacks can be implemented in a straight forward manner. This benchmark reviews those issues surrounding the most common mechanisms of replicating data between hosts. There are several PostgreSQL replication mechanisms and includes:</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:ul>
                  <xhtml:li>


Warm Standby (also known as LOG Shipping)
                                  <xhtml:ul>
                        <xhtml:li>Transaction logs are copied from the PRIMARY to SECONDARY host that reads the logs in a "recovery" mode. For all intents and purposes the host ingesting the WAL cannot be read i.e. it's off-line.</xhtml:li>
                     </xhtml:ul>
                  </xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>


Hot Standby
                                  <xhtml:ul>
                        <xhtml:li>Operates in the exact same fashion as the Warm Standby Server except that, in addition, it offers a read-only environment for client connections to connect and query.</xhtml:li>
                     </xhtml:ul>
                  </xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>


Point In Time Recovery (PITR)
                                  <xhtml:ul>
                        <xhtml:li>Primarily used for database forensics and recovery at particular points in time such as in the case that important data may have been accidentally removed. One can restore the cluster to a point in time before the event occurred.</xhtml:li>
                     </xhtml:ul>
                  </xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>


Streaming Replication
                                  <xhtml:ul>
                        <xhtml:li>


Uses an explicit connection, which in a manner of speaking is similar to the standard client connection, between the PRIMARY and STANDBY host. It too reads the transaction logs and ingests into a read-only server. What's different is that the connection uses a special replication protocol which is faster and more efficient than log shipping. Similar to standard client connections, it also honors the same authentication rules as expressed in the PostgreSQL host-based authentication file,                                               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">pg_hba.conf</xhtml:span>

A 'base backup' is a copy of the PRIMARY host's data cluster ($PGDATA) and is used to create STANDBY hosts and for Point In Time Recovery (PITR) mechanisms. Base backups should be copied across networks in a secure manner using an encrypted transport mechanism.

Write Ahead Log (WAL) Archiving, or Log Shipping, is the process of sending transaction log files from the PRIMARY host either to one or more STANDBY hosts or to be archived on a remote storage device for later use, e.g.                                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">PITR</xhtml:span>

, and                                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rynsc</xhtml:span>


. Basically, the server follows a set of runtime parameters which defines when the WAL should be copied using one of the aforementioned utilities.                            </xhtml:p>

pgBackRest aims to be a simple, reliable backup and restore system that can seamlessly scale up to the largest databases and workloads. Instead of relying on traditional backup tools like                                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">tar</xhtml:span>

 and                                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rsync</xhtml:span>


 allows for better solutions to database-specific backup challenges. The custom remote protocol allows for more flexibility and limits the types of connections that are required to perform a backup which increases security.                            </xhtml:p>

The native PostgreSQL backup facility                                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">pg_dump</xhtml:span>


 provides adequate logical backup operations but does not provide for Point In Time Recovery (PITR). The PostgreSQL facility                                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">pg_basebackup</xhtml:span>


 performs physical backup of the database files and does provide for PITR, but it is constrained by single threading. Both of these methodologies are standard in the PostgreSQL ecosystem and appropriate for particular backup/recovery needs.                                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">pgBackRest</xhtml:span>

                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">pgBackRest</xhtml:span>


 is open source software developed to perform efficient backups on PostgreSQL databases that measure in tens of terabytes and greater. It supports per file checksums, compression, partial/failed backup resume, high-performance parallel transfer, asynchronous archiving, tablespaces, expiration, full/differential/incremental, local/remote operation via SSH, hard-linking, restore,                                   <xhtml:strong>backup encryption</xhtml:strong>


, and more.                                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">pgBackRest</xhtml:span>

 or                                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">tar</xhtml:span>

 for your backup/recovery solution, ensure the repository, base backups, and WAL archives are stored on a reliable file system separate from the database server. Further, the external storage system where backups resided should have limited access to only those system administrators as necessary.

                  <xhtml:p>PostgreSQL permits local logins via the UNIX DOMAIN SOCKET and, for the most part, anyone with a legitimate Unix login account can make the attempt. Limiting PostgreSQL login attempts can be made by relocating the UNIX DOMAIN SOCKET to a subdirectory with restricted permissions.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>The creation and implementation of user-defined dynamic libraries is an extraordinary powerful capability. In the hands of an experienced DBA/programmer, it can significantly enhance the power and flexibility of the RDBMS. But new and unexpected behavior can also be assigned to the RDBMS, resulting in a very dangerous environment in what should otherwise be trusted.</xhtml:p>
