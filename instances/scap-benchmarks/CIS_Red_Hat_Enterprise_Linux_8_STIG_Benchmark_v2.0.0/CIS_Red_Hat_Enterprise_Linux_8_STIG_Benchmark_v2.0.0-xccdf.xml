      <xhtml:p>This document provides prescriptive guidance for establishing a secure configuration posture for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 systems running on x86_64 platforms.</xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p>This guide was developed and tested against Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.10</xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p>
The guidance within broadly assumes that operations are being performed as the       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root</xhtml:span>
 user, and executed under the default Bash version for the applicable distribution. Operations performed using       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">sudo</xhtml:span>
 instead of the       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root</xhtml:span>
 user, or executed under another shell, may produce unexpected results, or fail to make the intended changes to the system. Non-root users may not be able to access certain areas of the system, especially after remediation has been performed. It is advisable to verify       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root</xhtml:span>
 users path integrity and the integrity of any programs being run prior to execution of commands and scripts included in this benchmark.    </xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p>
The default prompt for the       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root</xhtml:span>
 user is       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">#</xhtml:span>
, and as such all sample commands will have       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">#</xhtml:span>
 as an additional indication that it is to be executed as       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root</xhtml:span>

   <xccdf:notice id="terms-of-use" xml:lang="en">	BACKGROUND.
	The Center for Internet Security ("CIS") provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to Internet users worldwide.	Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally generic in nature.	The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and devices.	Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to specific user requirements.	The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick fix" for anyone's information security needs.
	NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS.
	CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of	the Products or the Recommendations.	CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is" and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind.	USER AGREEMENTS.
	By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We") agree and acknowledge that:
	1.	No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component can be made fully secure;
	2.	We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our own risk;
	3.	We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from 		CIS's negligence or failure to perform; 
	4.	We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the 			Recommendations to our particular circumstances and requirements;
	5.	Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below) has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify us of 		the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and
	6.	Neither CIS nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise) for 		any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or damage 		to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, 	business interruption, wasted management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties) arising out of or in any way 	Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such 	damages), including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, 	viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other harmful items.
	GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS.
	CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use:
	1.	Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and 	use each of the Products on a single computer;
	2.	Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided 		that all such copies are printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed Terms of Use in its entirety.
	RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTION.
	The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and by international treaties.	We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties.	CIS reserves all rights not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights."
	Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute, encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device, without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi) use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product.	We will not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed in this paragraph.
	We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers, directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates, licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim.	We further agree that all CIS Parties are third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use.	SPECIAL RULES.
	CIS has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship.	Those special rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are covered by the special rules.
	CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization, whether by manual or electronic means.	Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time.
	CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION; VENUE.
	We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.	If any of these Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
	BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN ALL RESPECTS.</xccdf:notice>

               <xhtml:p>Several uncommon filesystem types are supported under Linux. Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the system. If a filesystem type is not needed it should be disabled. Native Linux file systems are designed to ensure that built-in security controls function as expected. Non-native filesystems can lead to unexpected consequences to both the security and functionality of the system and should be used with caution. Many filesystems are created for niche use cases and are not maintained and supported as the operating systems are updated and patched. Users of non-native filesystems should ensure that there is attention and ongoing support for them, especially in light of frequent operating system changes.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Standard network connectivity and Internet access to cloud storage may make the use of non-standard filesystem formats to directly attach heterogeneous devices much less attractive.</xhtml:p>

 application packages of software are self-contained and work across a range of Linux distributions. This is unlike traditional Linux package management approaches, like APT or RPM, which require specifically adapted packages per Linux distribution on an application update and delay therefore application deployment from developers to their software's end-user. Snaps themselves have no dependency on any external store ("App store"), can be obtained from any source and can be therefore used for upstream software deployment.                  </xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>Directories that are used for system-wide functions can be further protected by placing them on separate partitions. This provides protection for resource exhaustion and enables the use of mounting options that are applicable to the directory's intended use. Users' data can be stored on separate partitions and have stricter mount options. A user partition is a filesystem that has been established for use by the users and does not contain software for system operations.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>The recommendations in this section are easier to perform during initial system installation. If the system is already installed, it is recommended that a full backup be performed before repartitioning the system.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:strong>Note:</xhtml:strong>

 you are repartitioning a system that has already been installed (This may require the system to be in single-user mode):          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:ul>
                  <xhtml:li>
Mount the new partition to a temporary mountpoint e.g.               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">mount /dev/sda2 /mnt</xhtml:span>
                  </xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>
Copy data from the original partition to the new partition. e.g.               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">cp -a /var/tmp/* /mnt</xhtml:span>
                  </xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>
Verify that all data is present on the new partition. e.g.               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ls -la /mnt</xhtml:span>
                  </xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>
Unmount the new partition. e.g.               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umount /mnt</xhtml:span>
                  </xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>
Remove the data from the original directory that was in the old partition. e.g.               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rm -Rf /var/tmp/*</xhtml:span>
 Otherwise it will still consume space in the old partition that will be masked when the new filesystem is mounted.            </xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>
Mount the new partition to the desired mountpoint. e.g.               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">mount /dev/sda2 /var/tmp</xhtml:span>
                  </xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>
Update               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/fstab</xhtml:span>
 with the new mountpoint. e.g.               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/dev/sda2  /var/tmp  xfs   defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime 0 0</xhtml:span>

Since                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">tmpfs</xhtml:span>

By design files saved to                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>
 should have no expectation of surviving a reboot of the system.                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">tmpfs</xhtml:span>
 is ram based and all files stored to                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">tmpfs</xhtml:span>
 will be lost when the system is rebooted.                    </xhtml:p>
                              <xhtml:p>
If files need to be persistent through a reboot, they should be saved to                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/tmp</xhtml:span>
 not                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>

Since the                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>
 directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">tmpfs</xhtml:span>
 or a separate partition.                    </xhtml:p>

Running out of                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>
 space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it, but in a configuration where                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>
 is not a separate file system it will essentially have the whole disk available, as the default installation only creates a single                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/</xhtml:span>
 partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>
 (as with                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">tmpfs</xhtml:span>
) will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily. Another alternative is to create a dedicated partition for                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>
 from a separate volume or disk. One of the downsides of a disk-based dedicated partition is that it will be slower than                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">tmpfs</xhtml:span>
 which is RAM-based.                    </xhtml:p>

When modifying                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/home</xhtml:span>
 it is advisable to bring the system to emergency mode (so auditd is not running), rename the existing directory, mount the new file system, and migrate the data over before returning to multi-user mode.                </xhtml:p>

The default installation only creates a single                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/</xhtml:span>
 partition. Since the                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/home</xhtml:span>
 directory contains user generated data, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/home</xhtml:span>
 and impact all local users.              </xhtml:p>

Configuring                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/home</xhtml:span>
 as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">noexec/nosuid/nodev</xhtml:span>
. These options limit an attacker's ability to create exploits on the system. In the case of                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/home</xhtml:span>
 options such as                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">usrquota/grpquota</xhtml:span>
 may be considered to limit the impact that users can have on each other with regards to disk resource exhaustion. Other options allow for specific behavior. See                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">man mount</xhtml:span>
 for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options.              </xhtml:p>

                     <xhtml:p>
The reasoning for mounting                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var</xhtml:span>
 on a separate partition is as follows.              </xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>
The default installation only creates a single                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/</xhtml:span>
 partition. Since the                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var</xhtml:span>
 directory may contain world writable files and directories, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var</xhtml:span>
 and cause unintended behavior across the system as the disk is full. See                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">man auditd.conf</xhtml:span>
 for details.              </xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>
Configuring                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var</xhtml:span>
 as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">noexec/nosuid/nodev</xhtml:span>
. These options limit an attacker's ability to create exploits on the system. Other options allow for specific behavior. See                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">man mount</xhtml:span>
 for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options.              </xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>
An example of exploiting                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var</xhtml:span>
 may be an attacker establishing a hard-link to a system                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">setuid</xhtml:span>
 program and waiting for it to be updated. Once the program is updated, the hard-link can be broken and the attacker would have their own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw.              </xhtml:p>

 file which can grow quite large, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log/audit</xhtml:span>

Configuring                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log/audit</xhtml:span>

                  <xhtml:p>Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) provides a set of tools that simplifies managing the encrypted devices. With LUKS, you can encrypt block devices and enable multiple user keys to decrypt a master key. For bulk encryption of the partition, use this master key.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Red Hat Enterprise Linux uses LUKS to perform block device encryption. By default, the option to encrypt the block device is unchecked during the installation. If you select the option to encrypt your disk, the system prompts you for a passphrase every time you boot the computer. This passphrase unlocks the bulk encryption key that decrypts your partition. If you want to modify the default partition table, you can select the partitions that you want to encrypt. This is set in the partition table settings.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>
The default cipher used for LUKS is               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">aes-xts-plain64</xhtml:span>
. The default key size for LUKS is               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">512 bits</xhtml:span>

                  <xhtml:p>Timely patching is critical for maintaining the operational availability, confidentiality, and integrity of information technology (IT) systems. New patches are released frequently, and it is often difficult to keep abreast of all the new patches. When new weaknesses in an operating system exist, patches are usually made available by the vendor to resolve the problems. If the most recent security patches and updates are not installed, unauthorized users may take advantage of weaknesses in the unpatched software. The lack of prompt attention to patching could result in a system compromise.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>Mandatory Access Control (MAC) provides an additional layer of access restrictions to processes on top of the base Discretionary Access Controls. By restricting how processes can access files and resources on a system the potential impact from vulnerabilities in the processes can be reduced.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:strong>Impact:</xhtml:strong>
 Mandatory Access Control limits the capabilities of applications and daemons on a system, while this can prevent unauthorized access the configuration of MAC can be complex and difficult to implement correctly preventing legitimate access from occurring.        </xhtml:p>

            <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
               <xhtml:p>SELinux implements Mandatory Access Control (MAC). Every process and system resource has a special security label called an SELinux context. A SELinux context, sometimes referred to as an SELinux label, is an identifier which abstracts away the system-level details and focuses on the security properties of the entity. Not only does this provide a consistent way of referencing objects in the SELinux policy, but it also removes any ambiguity that can be found in other identification methods. For example, a file can have multiple valid path names on a system that makes use of bind mounts.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>The SELinux policy uses these contexts in a series of rules which define how processes can interact with each other and the various system resources. By default, the policy does not allow any interaction unless a rule explicitly grants access.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>In Fedora 28 Family Linux distributions, system services are controlled by the systemd daemon; systemd starts and stops all services, and users and processes communicate with systemd using the systemctl utility.  The systemd daemon can consult the SELinux policy and check the label of the calling process and the label of the unit file that the caller tries to manage, and then ask SELinux whether or not the caller is allowed the access. This approach strengthens access control to critical system capabilities, which include starting and stopping system services.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>This automatically limits the damage that the software can do to files accessible by the calling user. The user does not need to take any action to gain this benefit. For an action to occur, both the traditional DAC permissions must be satisfied as well as the SELinux MAC rules. The action will not be allowed if either one of these models does not permit the action. In this way, SELinux rules can only make a system's permissions more restrictive and secure. SELinux requires a complex policy to allow all the actions required of a system under normal operation.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Two such policies have been designed for use with Fedora 28 Family Linux distributions and are included with the system:</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:ul>
                  <xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">targeted</xhtml:span>
 - Targeted processes run in their own domain, called a confined domain. In a confined domain, the files that a targeted process has access to are limited. If a confined process is compromised by an attacker, the attacker’s access to resources and the possible damage they can do is also limited. SELinux denies access to these resources and logs the denial.            </xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">mls</xhtml:span>
 - Implements Multi-Level Security (MLS), which introduces even more kinds of labels (sensitivity and category) and rules that govern access based on these.            </xhtml:li>
               </xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:p>
This section provides guidance for the configuration of the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">targeted</xhtml:span>
 policy.          </xhtml:p>

               </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:ul>
                  <xhtml:li>Remember that SELinux policy rules are checked after DAC rules. SELinux policy rules are not used if DAC rules deny access first, which means that no SELinux denial is logged if the traditional DAC rules prevent the access.</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>This section only applies if SELinux is in use on the system. Additional Mandatory Access Control systems exist.</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>To avoid incorrect SELinux labeling and subsequent problems, ensure that you start services using a systemctl start command.</xhtml:li>

            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>
In Fedora 28 based distributions, the kernel command-line parameters for systems using the GRUB2 bootloader were defined in the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">kernelopts</xhtml:span>
 environment variable. This variable was stored in the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/boot/grub2/grubenv</xhtml:span>
 file for each kernel boot entry. However, storing the kernel command-line parameters using             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">kernelopts</xhtml:span>
 was not robust. Therefore, the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">kernelopts</xhtml:span>
 has been removed and the kernel command-line parameters are now stored in the Boot Loader Specification (BLS) snippet, instead of in the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/boot/loader/entries/&lt;KERNEL_BOOT_ENTRY&gt;.conf</xhtml:span>
 file.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
Boot loader configuration files are unified across CPU architectures
            <xhtml:ul>
                     <xhtml:li>
Configuration files for the GRUB boot loader are now stored in the                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/boot/grub2/</xhtml:span>
 directory on all supported CPU architectures. The                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg</xhtml:span>
 file, which GRUB previously used as the main configuration file on UEFI systems, now simply loads the                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/boot/grub2/grub.cfg</xhtml:span>
 file.              </xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
This change simplifies the layout of the GRUB configuration file, improves user experience, and provides the following notable benefits:
                <xhtml:ul>
                           <xhtml:li>You can boot the same installation with either EFI or legacy BIOS.</xhtml:li>
                           <xhtml:li>You can use the same documentation and commands for all architectures.</xhtml:li>
                           <xhtml:li>GRUB configuration tools are more robust, because they no longer rely on symbolic links and they do not have to handle platform-specific cases.</xhtml:li>
                           <xhtml:li>The usage of the GRUB configuration files is aligned with images generated by CoreOS Assembler (COSA) and OSBuild.</xhtml:li>
                           <xhtml:li>The usage of the GRUB configuration files is aligned with other Linux distributions.</xhtml:li>
                           <xhtml:li>Fedora 28 based distributions no longer boot on 32-bit UEFI</xhtml:li>
                        </xhtml:ul>
                     </xhtml:li>
                  </xhtml:ul>
               </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
Support for the 32-bit UEFI firmware was removed from the GRUB and shim boot loaders. As a consequence, Fedora 28 based distributions require a 64-bit UEFI, and can no longer boot on 64-bit systems that use a 32-bit UEFI.

               <xhtml:p>Rescue mode provides the ability to boot a small Linux environment entirely from CD-ROM, or some other boot method, instead of the system's hard drive.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>As the name implies, rescue mode is provided to rescue you from something. During normal operation, your Linux system uses files located on your system's hard drive to do everything — run programs, store your files, and more.
However, there may be times when you are unable to get Linux running completely enough to access files on your system's hard drive. Using rescue mode, you can access the files stored on your system's hard drive, even if you cannot actually run Linux from that hard drive.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>Syscalls are special routines in the Linux kernel, which userspace applications ask to do privileged tasks. Invoking a system call is an expensive operation because the processor must interrupt the currently executing task and switch context to kernel mode and then back to userspace after the system call completes. Virtual syscalls map into user space a page that contains some variables and the implementation of some system calls. This allows the system calls to be executed in userspace to alleviate the context switching expense.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Virtual syscalls provide an opportunity of attack for a user who has control of the return instruction pointer. Disabling vsyscalls help to prevent return oriented programming (ROP) attacks via buffer overflows and overruns. If the system intends to run containers based on RHEL 6 components, then virtual syscalls will need to be enabled so the components function properly.</xhtml:p>

The             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ptrace()</xhtml:span>
 system call provides a means by which one process (the "tracer") may observe and control the execution of another process (the "tracee"), and examine and change the tracee's memory and registers.          </xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">0</xhtml:span>
 - classic ptrace permissions: a process can PTRACE_ATTACH to any other process running under the same uid, as long as it is dumpable (i.e. did not transition uids, start privileged, or have called prctl(PR_SET_DUMPABLE...) already). Similarly, PTRACE_TRACEME is unchanged.            </xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">1</xhtml:span>
 - restricted ptrace: a process must have a predefined relationship with the inferior it wants to call PTRACE_ATTACH on. By default, this relationship is that of only its descendants when the above classic criteria is also met. To change the relationship, an inferior can call prctl(PR_SET_PTRACER, debugger, ...) to declare an allowed debugger PID to call PTRACE_ATTACH on the inferior. Using PTRACE_TRACEME is unchanged.            </xhtml:li>

               <xhtml:p>Discretionary Access Control (DAC) is based on the notion that individual users are "owners" of objects and therefore have discretion over who should be authorized to access the object and in which mode (e.g., read or write). Ownership is usually acquired as a consequence of creating the object or via specified ownership assignment. DAC allows the owner to determine who will have access to objects they control. An example of DAC includes user-controlled file permissions.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects are not constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information for which they have already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been granted access to information are not prevented from passing (i.e., the subjects have the discretion to pass) the information to other subjects or objects. A subject that is constrained in its operation by Mandatory Access Control policies is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of this requirement. Thus, while Mandatory Access Control imposes constraints preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity level, this requirement permits the subject to pass the information to any subject at the same sensitivity level. The policy is bounded by the information system boundary. Once the information is passed outside the control of the information system, additional means may be required to ensure the constraints remain in effect. While the older, more traditional definitions of discretionary access control require identity-based access control, that limitation is not required for this use of discretionary access control.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>By enabling the fs.protected_symlinks kernel parameter, symbolic links are permitted to be followed only when outside a sticky world-writable directory, or when the UID of the link and follower match, or when the directory owner matches the symlink's owner. Disallowing such symlinks helps mitigate vulnerabilities based on insecure file system accessed by privileged programs, avoiding an exploitation vector exploiting unsafe use of open() or creat().</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>Discretionary Access Control (DAC) is based on the notion that individual users are "owners" of objects and therefore have discretion over who should be authorized to access the object and in which mode (e.g., read or write). Ownership is usually acquired as a consequence of creating the object or via specified ownership assignment. DAC allows the owner to determine who will have access to objects they control. An example of DAC includes user-controlled file permissions.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects are not constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information for which they have already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been granted access to information are not prevented from passing (i.e., the subjects have the discretion to pass) the information to other subjects or objects. A subject that is constrained in its operation by Mandatory Access Control policies is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of this requirement. Thus, while Mandatory Access Control imposes constraints preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity level, this requirement permits the subject to pass the information to any subject at the same sensitivity level. The policy is bounded by the information system boundary. Once the information is passed outside the control of the information system, additional means may be required to ensure the constraints remain in effect. While the older, more traditional definitions of discretionary access control require identity-based access control, that limitation is not required for this use of discretionary access control.</xhtml:p>

The sysctl --system command will load settings from all system configuration files. All configuration files are sorted by their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of which of the directories they reside in. If multiple files specify the same option, the entry in the file with the lexicographically latest name will take precedence. Files are read from directories in the following list from top to bottom. Once a file of a given filename is loaded, any file of the same name in subsequent directories is ignored.

The             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ptrace()</xhtml:span>

                  <xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">0</xhtml:span>
 - classic ptrace permissions: a process can PTRACE_ATTACH to any other process running under the same uid, as long as it is dumpable (i.e. did not transition uids, start privileged, or have called prctl(PR_SET_DUMPABLE...) already). Similarly, PTRACE_TRACEME is unchanged.            </xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">1</xhtml:span>
 - restricted ptrace: a process must have a predefined relationship with the inferior it wants to call PTRACE_ATTACH on. By default, this relationship is that of only its descendants when the above classic criteria is also met. To change the relationship, an inferior can call prctl(PR_SET_PTRACER, debugger, ...) to declare an allowed debugger PID to call PTRACE_ATTACH on the inferior. Using PTRACE_TRACEME is unchanged.            </xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">2</xhtml:span>
 - admin-only attach: only processes with CAP_SYS_PTRACE may use ptrace with PTRACE_ATTACH, or through children calling PTRACE_TRACEME.            </xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">3</xhtml:span>
 - no attach: no processes may use ptrace with PTRACE_ATTACH nor via PTRACE_TRACEME. Once set, this sysctl value cannot be changed.            </xhtml:li>

 - This policy ensures maximum compatibility with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and earlier; it is less secure due to an increased attack surface. In addition to the DEFAULT level algorithms and protocols, it includes support for the TLS 1.0 and 1.1 protocols. The algorithms DSA, 3DES, and RC4 are allowed, while RSA keys and Diffie-Hellman parameters are accepted if they are at least 1023 bits long.          </xhtml:li>

 - A stricter forward-looking security level intended for testing a possible future policy. This policy does not allow the use of SHA-1 in signature algorithms. It allows the TLS 1.2 and 1.3 protocols, as well as the IKEv2 and SSH2 protocols. The RSA keys and Diffie-Hellman parameters are accepted if they are at least 3072 bits long.

 - A policy level that conforms with the FIPS 140 requirements. The fips-mode-setup tool, which switches the RHEL system into FIPS mode, uses this policy internally. Switching to the FIPS policy does not guarantee compliance with the FIPS 140 standard. You also must re-generate all cryptographic keys after you set the system to FIPS mode. This is not possible in many scenarios.          </xhtml:li>

 FIPS is required by local site policy:            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>
The system-wide cryptographic policies contain a policy level that enables cryptographic algorithms in accordance with the requirements by the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 140. The fips-mode-setup tool that enables or disables FIPS mode internally uses the FIPS systemwide cryptographic policy.
Switching the system to FIPS mode by using the FIPS system-wide cryptographic policy does not guarantee compliance with the FIPS 140 standard. Re-generating all cryptographic keys after setting the system to FIPS mode may not be possible. For example, in the case of an existing IdM realm with users' cryptographic keys you cannot re-generate all the keys. The fips-mode-setup tool uses the FIPS policy internally. But on top of what the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">update-crypto-policies</xhtml:span>

            <xccdf:title xml:lang="en">Ensure system-wide crypto policy is FIPS</xccdf:title>
            <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
               <xhtml:p>The operating system must implement NIST FIPS-validated cryptography for the following: to provision digital signatures, to generate cryptographic hashes, and to protect data requiring data-at-rest protections in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>
The system-wide cryptographic policies contain a policy level that enables cryptographic algorithms in accordance with the requirements by the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 140. The fips-mode-setup tool that enables or disables FIPS mode internally uses the FIPS systemwide cryptographic policy. Switching the system to FIPS mode by using the FIPS system-wide cryptographic policy does not guarantee compliance with the FIPS 140 standard. Re-generating all cryptographic keys after setting the system to FIPS mode may not be possible. For example, in the case of an existing IdM realm with users' cryptographic keys you cannot re-generate all the keys. The fips-mode-setup tool uses the FIPS policy internally. But on top of what the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">update-crypto-policies</xhtml:span>
 command with the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">--set FIPS</xhtml:span>
 option does,             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">fips-mode-setup</xhtml:span>
 ensures the installation of the FIPS             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">dracut</xhtml:span>
 module by using the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">fips-finish-install</xhtml:span>
 tool, it also adds the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">fips=1</xhtml:span>
 boot option to the kernel command line and regenerates the initial ramdisk.          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:strong>IMPORTANT:</xhtml:strong>
 Only enabling FIPS mode during installation ensures that the system generates all keys with FIPS-approved algorithms and continuous monitoring tests in place.          </xhtml:p>

To enable strict FIPS compliance, the                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">fips=1</xhtml:span>
 kernel option needs to be added to the kernel boot parameters during system installation so key generation is done with FIPS-approved algorithms and continuous monitoring tests in place. Users must also ensure the system has plenty of entropy during the installation process by moving the mouse around, or if no mouse is available, ensuring that many keystrokes are typed. The recommended amount of keystrokes is 256 and more. Less than 256 keystrokes may generate a nonunique key.                </xhtml:li>

               <xhtml:p>A trust anchor is an authoritative entity represented via a public key and associated data. It is used in the context of public key infrastructures, X.509 digital certificates, and DNSSEC.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption is a required security setting as a number of known vulnerabilities have been reported against Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and earlier versions of TLS. Encryption of private information is essential to ensuring data confidentiality. If private information is not encrypted, it can be intercepted and easily read by an unauthorized party. SQL Server must use a minimum of FIPS 140-2-approved TLS version 1.2, and all non-FIPS-approved SSL and TLS versions must be disabled. NIST SP 800-52 specifies the preferred configurations for government systems.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>Presenting a warning message prior to the normal user login may assist in the prosecution of trespassers on the computer system.

Guidelines published by the US Department of Defense require that warning messages include at least the name of the organization that owns the system, the fact that the system is subject to monitoring and that such monitoring is in compliance with local statutes, and that use of the system implies consent to such monitoring. It is important that the organization's legal counsel review the content of all messages before any system modifications are made, as these warning messages are inherently site-specific.

If accidentally pressed, as could happen in the case of a mixed OS environment, this can create the risk of short-term loss of availability of systems due to unintentional reboot. In a graphical user environment, risk of unintentional reboot from the Ctrl-Alt-Delete sequence is reduced because the user will be prompted before any action is taken.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>A session time-out lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system but does not log out because of the temporary nature of the absence. Rather than relying on the user to manually lock their operating system session prior to vacating the vicinity, operating systems need to be able to identify when a user's session has idled and take action to initiate the session lock.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>The most important characteristic of a random number generator is its randomness, namely its ability to deliver random numbers that are impossible to predict. Entropy in computer security is associated with the unpredictability of a source of randomness. The random source with high entropy tends to achieve a uniform distribution of random values. Random number generators are one of the most important building blocks of cryptosystems.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>The rngd service feeds random data from hardware device to kernel random device. Quality (non-predictable) random number generation is important for several security functions (i.e., ciphers).</xhtml:p>

         <xhtml:p>While applying system updates and patches helps correct known vulnerabilities, one of the best ways to protect the system against as yet unreported vulnerabilities is to disable all services that are not required for normal system operation. This prevents the exploitation of vulnerabilities discovered at a later date. If a service is not enabled, it cannot be exploited. The actions in this section of the document provide guidance on some services which can be safely disabled and under which circumstances, greatly reducing the number of possible threats to the resulting system. Additionally, some services which should remain enabled but with secure configuration are covered as well as insecure service clients.</xhtml:p>

                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">crontab</xhtml:span>
 is the program used to install, deinstall, or list the tables used to drive the cron daemon. Each user can have their own crontab, and though these are files in               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/spool/cron/crontabs</xhtml:span>
, they are not intended to be edited directly.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>
If the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/cron.allow</xhtml:span>
 file exists, then you must be listed (one user per line) therein in order to be allowed to use this command. If the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/cron.allow</xhtml:span>
 file does not exist but the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/cron.deny</xhtml:span>
 file does exist, then you must not be listed in the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/cron.deny</xhtml:span>
 file in order to use this command.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>If neither of these files exists, then depending on site-dependent configuration parameters, only the super user will be allowed to use this command, or all users will be able to use this command.</xhtml:p>

If both files exist then               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/cron.allow</xhtml:span>
 takes precedence. Which means that               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/cron.deny</xhtml:span>
 is not considered and your user must be listed in               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/cron.allow</xhtml:span>
 in order to be able to use the crontab.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Regardless of the existence of any of these files, the root administrative user is always allowed to setup a crontab.</xhtml:p>

, if they exist, must be either world-readable, or readable by group               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">crontab</xhtml:span>

                  <xhtml:p>
There is one file for each user's crontab under the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/spool/cron/crontabs</xhtml:span>
 directory. Users are not allowed to edit the files under that directory directly to ensure that only users allowed by the system to run periodic tasks can add them, and only syntactically correct crontabs will be written there. This is enforced by having the directory writable only by the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">crontab</xhtml:span>
 group and configuring crontab command with the setgid bid set for that specific group.            </xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:ul>
                     <xhtml:li>
Even though a given user is not listed in                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">cron.allow</xhtml:span>
, cron jobs can still be run as that user              </xhtml:li>

On many systems, only the system administrator is authorized to schedule               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">cron</xhtml:span>
 jobs. Using the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">cron.allow</xhtml:span>

 allows fairly complex time specifications, extending the POSIX.2 standard. It accepts times of the form HH:MM to run a job at a specific time of day. (If that time is already past, the next day is assumed.) You may also specify midnight, noon, or teatime (4pm) and you can have a time-of-day suffixed with AM or PM for running in the morning or the evening. You can also say what day the job will be run, by giving a date in the form month-name day with an optional year, or giving a date of the form MMDD[CC]YY, MM/DD/[CC]YY,  DD.MM.[CC]YY or [CC]YY-MM-DD. The specification of a date must follow the specification of the time of day. You can also give times like now + count time-units, where the time-units can be minutes, hours, days, or weeks and you can tell at to run the job today by suffixing the time with today and to run the job tomorrow by suffixing the time with tomorrow.            </xhtml:p>

 files determine which user can submit commands for later execution via at or batch. The format of the files is a list of usernames, one on each line. Whitespace is not permitted. If the file               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/at.allow</xhtml:span>
 exists, only usernames mentioned in it are allowed to use at. If               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/at.allow</xhtml:span>

               <xhtml:p>A new feature that RHEL 8 operating systems provide is the USBGuard software framework. The USBguard-daemon is the main component of the USBGuard software framework. It runs as a service in the background and enforces the USB device authorization policy for all USB devices. The policy is defined by a set of rules using a rule language described in the "usbguard-rules.conf" file. The policy and the authorization state of USB devices can be modified during runtime using the USBGuard tool.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>The System Administrator (SA) must work with the site Information System Security Officer (ISSO) to determine a list of authorized peripherals and establish rules within the USBGuard software framework to allow only authorized devices.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>The organization must identify authorized software programs and permit execution of authorized software. The process used to identify software programs that are authorized to execute on organizational information systems is commonly referred to as whitelisting or more correctly allow listing.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Utilizing a whitelist provides a configuration management method for allowing the execution of only authorized software. Using only authorized software decreases risk by limiting the number of potential vulnerabilities. Verification of whitelisted software occurs prior to execution or at system startup.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>RHEL 8 operating systems ship with many optional packages. One such package is a file access policy daemon called "fapolicyd". "fapolicyd" is a userspace daemon that determines access rights to files based on attributes of the process and file.

               <xhtml:p>Proceed with caution with enforcing the use of this daemon. Improper configuration may render the system non-functional. The "fapolicyd" API is not namespace aware and can cause issues when launching or running containers.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>Without protection of communications with wireless peripherals, confidentiality and integrity may be compromised because unprotected communications can be intercepted and either read, altered, or used to compromise the operating system.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>This requirement applies to wireless peripheral technologies (e.g., wireless mice, keyboards, displays, etc.) used with RHEL 8 operating systems. Wireless peripherals (e.g., Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/IR Keyboards, Mice, and Pointing Devices and Near Field Communications [NFC]) present a unique challenge by creating an open, unsecured port on a computer. Wireless peripherals must meet DoD requirements for wireless data transmission and be approved for use by the Authorizing Official (AO). Even though some wireless peripherals, such as mice and pointing devices, do not ordinarily carry information that need to be protected, modification of communications with these wireless peripherals may be used to compromise the operating system. Communication paths outside the physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of interception and modification.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of communications with wireless peripherals can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., employing physical barriers to wireless radio frequencies) or by logical means (e.g., employing cryptographic techniques). If physical means of protection are employed, then logical means (cryptography) do not have to be employed, and vice versa. If the wireless peripheral is only passing telemetry data, encryption of the data may not be required.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>Accepting ICMP echo and timestamp requests with broadcast or multicast destinations for your network could be used to trick your host into starting (or participating) in a Smurf attack. A Smurf attack relies on an attacker sending large amounts of ICMP broadcast messages with a spoofed source address. All hosts receiving this message and responding would send echo-reply messages back to the spoofed address, which is probably not routable. If many hosts respond to the packets, the amount of traffic on the network could be significantly multiplied.</xhtml:p>

 forces the Linux kernel to utilize reverse path filtering on a received packet to determine if the packet was valid. Essentially, with reverse path filtering, if the return packet does not go out the same interface that the corresponding source packet came from, the packet is dropped (and logged if             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">log_martians</xhtml:span>

 is a good way to deter attackers from sending your system bogus packets that cannot be responded to. One instance where this feature breaks down is if asymmetrical routing is employed. This would occur when using dynamic routing protocols (bgp, ospf, etc) on your system. If you are using asymmetrical routing on your system, you will not be able to enable this feature without breaking the routing.          </xhtml:p>

 disables the system from accepting source routed packets. Assume this system was capable of routing packets to Internet routable addresses on one interface and private addresses on another interface. Assume that the private addresses were not routable to the Internet routable addresses and vice versa. Under normal routing circumstances, an attacker from the Internet routable addresses could not use the system as a way to reach the private address systems. If, however, source routed packets were allowed, they could be used to gain access to the private address systems as the route could be specified, rather than rely on routing protocols that did not allow this routing.          </xhtml:p>

When             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">tcp_syncookies</xhtml:span>
 is set, the kernel will handle TCP SYN packets normally until the half-open connection queue is full, at which time, the SYN cookie functionality kicks in. SYN cookies work by not using the SYN queue at all. Instead, the kernel simply replies to the SYN with a SYN/ACK, but will include a specially crafted TCP sequence number that encodes the source and destination IP address and port number and the time the packet was sent. A legitimate connection would send the ACK packet of the three way handshake with the specially crafted sequence number. This allows the system to verify that it has received a valid response to a SYN cookie and allow the connection, even though there is no corresponding SYN in the queue.          </xhtml:p>

It is recommended that systems do not accept router advertisements as they could be tricked into routing traffic to compromised machines. Setting hard routes within the system (usually a single default route to a trusted router) protects the system from bad routes.

 and             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_ra</xhtml:span>

         <xhtml:p>A Host Based Firewall, on a Linux system, is a set of rules. When a data packet moves into or out of a protected network space, its contents (in particular, information about its origin, target, and the protocol it plans to use) are tested against the firewall rules to see if it should be allowed through</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>To provide a Host Based Firewall, the Linux kernel includes support for nftables.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">nftables</xhtml:span>
 - A subsystem of the Linux kernel providing filtering and classification of network packets/datagrams/frames. nftables is supposed to replace certain parts of Netfilter, while keeping and reusing most of it. nftables utilizes the building blocks of the Netfilter infrastructure, such as the existing hooks into the networking stack, connection tracking system, userspace queueing component, and logging subsystem.        </xhtml:li>
         </xhtml:ul>
         <xhtml:p>In order to configure firewall rules for nftables, a firewall utility needs to be installed.  Guidance has been included for the following firewall utilities:</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">FirewallD</xhtml:span>
 - Provides firewall features by acting as a front-end for the Linux kernel's netfilter framework via the nftables backend.  Starting in v0.6.0, FirewallD added support for acting as a front-end for the Linux kernel's netfilter framework via the nftables userspace utility, acting as an alternative to the nft command line program. firewalld supports both IPv4 and IPv6 networks and can administer separate firewall zones with varying degrees of trust as defined in zone profiles.        </xhtml:li>

               <xhtml:p>DoS is a condition when a resource is not available for legitimate users. When this occurs, the organization either cannot accomplish its mission or must operate at degraded capacity.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>This requirement addresses the configuration of the operating system to mitigate the impact of DoS attacks that have occurred or are ongoing on system availability. For each system, known and potential DoS attacks must be identified and solutions for each type implemented. A variety of technologies exists to limit or, in some cases, eliminate the effects of DoS attacks (e.g., limiting processes or establishing memory partitions). Employing increased capacity and bandwidth, combined with service redundancy, may reduce the susceptibility to some DoS attacks.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Since version 0.6.0, "firewalld" has incorporated "nftables" as its backend support. Utilizing the limit statement in "nftables" can help to mitigate DoS attacks.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>
The recommendations in this section only apply if the SSH daemon is installed on the system,           <xhtml:strong>if remote access is not required the SSH daemon can be removed and this section skipped</xhtml:strong>

, may cause the audits in this section's recommendations to report incorrectly. It is recommended that these options only be used if they're needed and fully understood. If these options are configured in accordance with local site policy, they should be accounted for when following the recommendations in this section.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
The default             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Include</xhtml:span>

 To clarify, the two settings described below are only meant for idle connections from a protocol perspective and are not meant to check if the user is active or not. An idle user does not mean an idle connection. SSH does not and never had, intentionally, the capability to drop idle users. In SSH versions before             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">8.2p1</xhtml:span>
 there was a bug that caused these values to behave in such a manner that they were abused to disconnect idle users. This bug has been resolved in             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">8.2p1</xhtml:span>
 and thus it can no longer be abused disconnect idle users.          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>
The two options             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveInterval</xhtml:span>
 and             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveCountMax</xhtml:span>

                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveInterval</xhtml:span>
 Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd(8) will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client.              </xhtml:p>

                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveCountMax</xhtml:span>
 Sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without sshd(8) receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the session.  It is important to note that the use of client alive messages is very different from TCPKeepAlive. The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel and therefore will not be spoofable. The TCP keepalive option en‐abled by TCPKeepAlive is spoofable. The client alive mechanism is valuable when the client or server depend on knowing when a connection has become unresponsive.
The default value is 3. If ClientAliveInterval is set to 15, and ClientAliveCountMax is left at the default, unresponsive SSH clients will be disconnected after approximately 45 seconds. Setting a zero ClientAliveCountMax disables connection termination.              </xhtml:p>

In order to prevent resource exhaustion, appropriate values should be set for both             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveInterval</xhtml:span>
 and             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveCountMax</xhtml:span>
. Specifically, looking at the source code,             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveCountMax</xhtml:span>
 must be greater than zero in order to utilize the ability of SSH to drop idle connections. If connections are allowed to stay open indefinitely, this can potentially be used as a DDOS attack or simple resource exhaustion could occur over unreliable networks.          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>The example set here is a 45 second timeout. Consult your site policy for network timeouts and apply as appropriate.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, de-allocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level and de-allocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system-level network connection.

               <xhtml:p>RHEL 8 operating systems utilize "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" for configurations of OpenSSH. Within the sshd_config the product of the values of "ClientAliveInterval" and "ClientAliveCountMax" are used to establish the inactivity threshold. The "ClientAliveInterval" is a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The "ClientAliveCountMax" is the number of client alive messages that may be sent without sshd receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is met, sshd will disconnect the client.

               <xhtml:p>The most important characteristic of a random number generator is its randomness, namely its ability to deliver random numbers that are impossible to predict. Entropy in computer security is associated with the unpredictability of a source of randomness. The random source with high entropy tends to achieve a uniform distribution of random values. Random number generators are one of the most important building blocks of cryptosystems.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>The SSH implementation in RHEL 8 operating systems uses the OPENSSL library, which does not use high-entropy sources by default. By using the "SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG" environment variable the OPENSSL random generator is reseeded from "/dev/random". This setting is not recommended on computers without the hardware random generator because insufficient entropy causes the connection to be blocked until enough entropy is available.</xhtml:p>

 Specifies the maximum amount of data that may be transmitted before the session key is renegotiated, optionally followed a maximum amount of time that may pass before the session key is renegotiated.

The             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">sudo</xhtml:span>
 command allows authorized users to run programs (including shells) as other users, system users, and root. The             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/sudoers</xhtml:span>
 file is used to configure authorized             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">sudo</xhtml:span>
 users as well as the programs they are allowed to run. Some configuration options in the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/sudoers</xhtml:span>
 file allow configured users to run programs without re-authenticating. Use of these configuration options makes it easier for one compromised account to be used to compromise other accounts.          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>
It is possible to include other sudoers files from within the sudoers file currently being parsed using the #include and #includedir directives. When             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">sudo</xhtml:span>
 reaches this line it will suspend processing of the current file (            <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/sudoers</xhtml:span>
) and switch to the specified file/directory. Once the end of the included file(s) is reached, the rest of             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/sudoers</xhtml:span>
 will be processed. Files that are included may themselves include other files. A hard limit of 128 nested include files is enforced to prevent include file loops.          </xhtml:p>

Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) is a service that implements modular authentication modules on UNIX systems.

Files for PAM are typically located in the           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/pam.d</xhtml:span>

                        <xhtml:ul>
                           <xhtml:li>
The PAM and authselect packages must be versions                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">pam-1.3.1-25</xhtml:span>
 and                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">authselect-1.2.6-1</xhtml:span>
 or newer                  </xhtml:li>
                           <xhtml:li>
The example is based on a custom profile built (copied) from the the                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">SSSD</xhtml:span>
 default authselect profile.                  </xhtml:li>
                           <xhtml:li>
The example does not include the                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">symlink</xhtml:span>
 option for the                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">PAM</xhtml:span>
 or                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Metadata</xhtml:span>
 files.  This is due to the fact that by linking the                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">PAM</xhtml:span>
 files future updates to                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">authselect</xhtml:span>
 may overwrite local site customizations to the custom profile                  </xhtml:li>
                           <xhtml:li>
The                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">--backup=PAM_CONFIG_BACKUP</xhtml:span>
 option will create a backup of the current config. The backup will be stored at                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/lib/authselect/backups/PAM_CONFIG_BACKUP</xhtml:span>
                           </xhtml:li>
                           <xhtml:li>
The                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">--force</xhtml:span>
 option will force the overwrite of the existing files and automatically backup system files before writing any change unless the                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">--nobackup</xhtml:span>
 option is set.
                    <xhtml:ul>
                                 <xhtml:li>
On a new system where authselect has not been configured. In this case, the                         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">--force</xhtml:span>
 option will force the selected authselect profile to be active and overwrite the existing files with files generated from the selected authselect profile's templates                      </xhtml:li>
                                 <xhtml:li>
On an existing system with a custom configuration. The                         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">--force</xhtml:span>
 option may be used, but                         <xhtml:strong>ensure that you note the backup location included as your custom files will be overwritten.</xhtml:strong>
 This will allow you to review the changes and add any necessary customizations to the template files for the authselect profile. After updating the templates, run the command                         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">authselect apply-changes</xhtml:span>
 to add these custom entries to the files in                         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/pam.d/</xhtml:span>
                                 </xhtml:li>

                           </xhtml:li>
                        </xhtml:ul>
                        <xhtml:p>
                           <xhtml:strong>- IF -</xhtml:strong>
 you receive an error ending with a message similar to:                </xhtml:p>
                        <xhtml:code class="code_block">

                        <xhtml:p>
This error is caused when the previous configuration was not created by authselect but by other tool or by manual changes and the                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">--force</xhtml:span>

                           <xhtml:p>
If local site customizations have been made to the authselect template or files in                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/pam.d</xhtml:span>
 these custom entries should be added to the newly created custom profile before it's applied to the system.                  </xhtml:p>

The               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">pam_pwquality.so</xhtml:span>
 module performs password quality checking. This module can be plugged into the password stack of a given service to provide strength-checking for passwords. The code was originally based on pam_cracklib module and the module is backwards compatible with its options.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>The action of this module is to prompt the user for a password and check its strength against a system dictionary and a set of rules for identifying poor choices.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>The first action is to prompt for a single password, check its strength and then, if it is considered strong, prompt for the password a second time (to verify that it was typed correctly on the first occasion). All being well, the password is passed on to subsequent modules to be installed as the new authentication token.</xhtml:p>

                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">local_users_only</xhtml:span>
 - Only track failed user authentications attempts for local users in /etc/passwd and ignore centralized (AD, IdM, LDAP, etc.) users. The faillock(8) command will also no longer track user failed authentication attempts. Enabling this option will prevent a double-lockout scenario where a user is locked out locally and in the centralized mechanism.              </xhtml:li>

                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">deny=&lt;n&gt;</xhtml:span>

                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">fail_interval=n</xhtml:span>
 - The length of the interval during which the consecutive authentication failures must happen for the user account lock out is n seconds. The default is 900 (15 minutes).              </xhtml:li>

                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">unlock_time=n</xhtml:span>
 - The access will be re-enabled after n seconds after the lock out. The value 0 has the same meaning as value never - the access will not be re-enabled without resetting the faillock entries by the faillock(8) command. The default is 600 (10 minutes). Note that the default directory that pam_faillock uses is usually cleared on system boot so the access will be also re-enabled after system reboot. If that is undesirable a different tally directory must be set with the dir option. Also note that it is usually undesirable to permanently lock out users as they can become easily a target of denial of service attack unless the usernames are random and kept secret to potential attackers.              </xhtml:li>

                     <xhtml:p>Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks. Password length is one factor of several that helps to determine strength and how long it takes to crack a password. Use of more characters in a password helps to increase exponentially the time and/or resources required to compromise the password.</xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>RHEL 8 operating systems utilize "pwquality" as a mechanism to enforce password complexity. Configurations are set in the "etc/security/pwquality.conf" file.</xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>The "minlen", sometimes noted as minimum length, acts as a "score" of complexity based on the credit components of the "pwquality" module. By setting the credit components to a negative value, not only will those components be required, they will not count towards the total "score" of "minlen". This will enable "minlen" to require a 15-character minimum.</xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>The DoD minimum password requirement is 15 characters.</xhtml:p>

                     <xhtml:p>Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks. "pwquality" enforces complex password construction configuration and has the ability to limit brute-force attacks on the system.</xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>RHEL 8 utilizes "pwquality" as a mechanism to enforce password complexity. This is set in both:
/etc/pam.d/password-auth
/etc/pam.d/system-auth
By limiting the number of attempts to meet the pwquality module complexity requirements before returning with an error, the system will audit abnormal attempts at password changes.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>The window of opportunity for an attacker to leverage compromised credentials or successfully compromise credentials via an online brute force attack is limited by the age of the password. Therefore, reducing the maximum age of a password also reduces an attacker's window of opportunity.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>We recommend a yearly password change. This is primarily because for all their good intentions users will share credentials across accounts. Therefore, even if a breach is publicly identified, the user may not see this notification, or forget they have an account on that site. This could leave a shared credential vulnerable indefinitely. Having an organizational policy of a 1-year (annual) password expiration is a reasonable compromise to mitigate this with minimal user burden.</xhtml:p>

The user file-creation mode mask (              <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
) is used to determine the file permission for newly created directories and files. In Linux, the default permissions for any newly created directory is 0777 (              <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rwxrwxrwx</xhtml:span>
), and for any newly created file it is 0666 (              <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rw-rw-rw-</xhtml:span>
). The               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 modifies the default Linux permissions by restricting (masking) these permissions. The               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 are cleared in the resulting file mode.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>

 (Numeric) Value - Represented by either three or four digits. ie                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask 0027</xhtml:span>
 or                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask 027</xhtml:span>
.  If a four digit umask is used, the first digit is ignored. The remaining three digits effect the resulting permissions for user, group, and world/other respectively.              </xhtml:li>

.  The permissions listed are not masked by                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
. ie a                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 set by                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask u=rwx,g=rx,o=</xhtml:span>
 is the                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Symbolic</xhtml:span>

                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask 027</xhtml:span>
.  This                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 would set a newly created directory with file mode                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">drwxr-x---</xhtml:span>

The user file-creation mode mask (              <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
) is used to determine the file permission for newly created directories and files. In Linux, the default permissions for any newly created directory is 0777 (              <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rwxrwxrwx</xhtml:span>
), and for any newly created file it is 0666 (              <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rw-rw-rw-</xhtml:span>
). The               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 modifies the default Linux permissions by restricting (masking) these permissions. The               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 are cleared in the resulting file mode.            </xhtml:p>

 or                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask 027</xhtml:span>

.  This                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>

                  <xhtml:p>Emergency accounts are privileged accounts established in response to crisis situations where the need for rapid account activation is required. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. If these accounts are automatically disabled, system maintenance during emergencies may not be possible, thus adversely affecting system availability.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Emergency accounts are different from infrequently used accounts (i.e., local logon accounts used by the organization's system administrators when network or normal logon/access is not available). Infrequently used accounts are not subject to automatic termination dates. Emergency accounts are accounts created in response to crisis situations, usually for use by maintenance personnel. The automatic expiration or disabling time period may be extended as needed until the crisis is resolved; however, it must not be extended indefinitely. A permanent account should be established for privileged users who need long-term maintenance accounts.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>To address access requirements, many RHEL operating systems can be integrated with enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements.</xhtml:p>

      <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
         <xhtml:p>The items in this section describe how to configure logging, log monitoring, and auditing, using tools included in most distributions.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>
It is recommended that         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rsyslog </xhtml:span>
be used for logging (with         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">logwatch </xhtml:span>
providing summarization) and         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">auditd</xhtml:span>
 be used for auditing (with         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">aureport </xhtml:span>
providing summarization) to automatically monitor logs for intrusion attempts and other suspicious system behavior.      </xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>In addition to the local log files created by the steps in this section, it is also recommended that sites collect copies of their system logs on a secure, centralized log server via an encrypted connection. Not only does centralized logging help sites correlate events that may be occurring on multiple systems, but having a second copy of the system log information may be critical after a system compromise where the attacker has modified the local log files on the affected system(s). If a log correlation system is deployed, configure it to process the logs described in this section.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>
Because it is often necessary to correlate log information from many different systems (particularly after a security incident) it is recommended that the time be synchronized among systems and devices connected to the local network. The standard Internet protocol for time synchronization is the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which is supported by most network-ready devices. Reference &lt;        <xhtml:a href="http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/">http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/</xhtml:a>
&gt; manual page for more information on configuring chrony.      </xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>It is important that all logs described in this section be monitored on a regular basis and correlated to determine trends. A seemingly innocuous entry in one log could be more significant when compared to an entry in another log.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:strong>Note on log file permissions:</xhtml:strong>
 There really isn't a "one size fits all" solution to the permissions on log files. Many sites utilize group permissions so that administrators who are in a defined security group, such as "wheel" do not have to elevate privileges to root in order to read log files. Also, if a third party log aggregation tool is used, it may need to have group permissions to read the log files, which is preferable to having it run setuid to root. Therefore, there are two remediation and audit steps for log file permissions. One is for systems that do not have a secured group method implemented that only permits root to read the log files (        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root:root 600</xhtml:span>
). The other is for sites that do have such a setup and are designated as         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root:securegrp 640 </xhtml:span>
where         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">securegrp</xhtml:span>
 is the defined security group (in some cases         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">wheel</xhtml:span>
).      </xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>AIDE is a file integrity checking tool. While it cannot prevent intrusions, it can detect unauthorized changes to configuration files by alerting when the files are changed. When setting up AIDE, decide internally what the site policy will be concerning integrity checking. Review the AIDE quick start guide and AIDE documentation before proceeding.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>Logging services should be configured to prevent information leaks and to aggregate logs on a remote server so that they can be reviewed in the event of a system compromise.

               <xhtml:li>Ensure that logs are rotated as per the environment requirements.</xhtml:li>

               <xhtml:li>Ensure all security logs are sent to a remote log server.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>Ensure the required events are logged.</xhtml:li>

            <xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:strong>What is covered</xhtml:strong>
            </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>
This section will cover the minimum best practices for the usage of           <xhtml:strong>
                  <xhtml:em>either</xhtml:em>
               </xhtml:strong>
               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rsyslog</xhtml:span>
               <xhtml:strong>
                  <xhtml:em>or</xhtml:em>
               </xhtml:strong>
               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">journald</xhtml:span>
. The recommendations are written such that each is wholly independent of each other and           <xhtml:strong>
                  <xhtml:em>only one is implemented</xhtml:em>
               </xhtml:strong>
.        </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>
If your organization makes use of an enterprise wide logging system completely outside of             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rsyslog</xhtml:span>
 or             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">journald</xhtml:span>
, then the following recommendations do not directly apply. However, the principals of the recommendations should be followed regardless of what solution is implemented. If the enterprise solution incorporates either of these tools, careful consideration should be given to the following recommendations to determine exactly what applies.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
Should your organization make use of both             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rsyslog</xhtml:span>
 and             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">journald</xhtml:span>
, take care how the recommendations may or may not apply to you.          </xhtml:li>
            </xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:strong>What is not covered</xhtml:strong>
            </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>
Enterprise logging systems not utilizing             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rsyslog</xhtml:span>
 or             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">journald</xhtml:span>
.
As logging is very situational and dependent on the local environment, not everything can be covered here.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
Transport layer security should be applied to all remote logging functionality. Both             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rsyslog</xhtml:span>
 and             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">journald</xhtml:span>
 supports secure transport and should be configured as such.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>The log server. There are a multitude of reasons for a centralized log server (and keeping a short period of logging on the local system), but the log server is out of scope for these recommendations.</xhtml:li>

The journal service stores log data either persistently below               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log/journal</xhtml:span>

 exists during boot, with an implicit fallback to volatile storage. Use               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Storage=</xhtml:span>
 in               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">journald.conf</xhtml:span>

               <xhtml:p>
The             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rsyslog</xhtml:span>
 software package may be used instead of the default             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">journald</xhtml:span>
 logging mechanism.          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Rsyslog has evolved over several decades. For this reason it supports three different configuration formats (“languages”):</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:ul>
                  <xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">basic</xhtml:span>
 - previously known as the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">sysklogd</xhtml:span>
 format, this is the format best used to express basic things, such as where the statement fits on a single line.
              <xhtml:ul>
                        <xhtml:li>It stems back to the original syslog.conf format, in use now for several decades.</xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:li>The most common use case is matching on facility/severity and writing matching messages to a log file.</xhtml:li>
                     </xhtml:ul>
                  </xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">advanced</xhtml:span>
 - previously known as the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">RainerScript</xhtml:span>
 format, this format was first available in rsyslog v6 and is the current, best and most precise format for non-trivial use cases where more than one line is needed.
              <xhtml:ul>
                        <xhtml:li>Prior to v7, there was a performance impact when using this format that encouraged use of the basic format for best results. Current versions of rsyslog do not suffer from this (historical) performance impact.</xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:li>This new style format is specifically targeted towards more advanced use cases like forwarding to remote hosts that might be partially offline.</xhtml:li>
                     </xhtml:ul>
                  </xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">obsolete legacy</xhtml:span>
 - previously known simply as the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">legacy</xhtml:span>
 format, this format is exactly what its name implies: it is obsolete and should not be used when writing new configurations. It was created in the early days (up to rsyslog version 5) where we expected that rsyslog would extend sysklogd just mildly. Consequently, it was primarily aimed at small additions to the original sysklogd format.
              <xhtml:ul>
                        <xhtml:li>Practice has shown that it was notoriously hard to use for more advanced use cases, and thus we replaced it with the advanced format.</xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:li>In essence, everything that needs to be written on a single line that starts with a dollar sign is legacy format. Users of this format are encouraged to migrate to the basic or advanced formats.</xhtml:li>
                     </xhtml:ul>
                  </xhtml:li>

As noted in the                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">systemd-journald</xhtml:span>
 man pages,                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">systemd-journald</xhtml:span>
 logs may be exported to                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rsyslog</xhtml:span>
 either through the process mentioned here, or through a facility like                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">systemd-journald.service</xhtml:span>
.  There are trade-offs involved in each implementation, where                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ForwardToSyslog</xhtml:span>
 will immediately capture all events (and forward to an external log server, if properly configured), but may not capture all boot-up activities.  Mechanisms such as                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">systemd-journald.service</xhtml:span>
, on the other hand, will record bootup events, but may delay sending the information to                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rsyslog</xhtml:span>
, leading to the potential for log manipulation prior to export.  Be aware of the limitations of all tools employed to secure a system.              </xhtml:p>

Rsyslog provides three ways to forward message: the traditional UDP transport, which is extremely lossy but standard; the plain TCP based transport, which loses messages only during certain situations but is widely available; and the RELP transport, which does not lose messages but is currently available only as part of the rsyslogd 3.15.0 and above.
Examples of each configuration:
UDP               <xhtml:em>.</xhtml:em>
 @remotesystemname
TCP               <xhtml:em>.</xhtml:em>
 @@remotesystemname
RELP               <xhtml:em>.</xhtml:em>
 :omrelp:remotesystemname:2514
Note that a port number was given as there is no standard port for RELP.            </xhtml:p>

Rsyslog provides three ways to forward message: the traditional UDP transport, which is extremely lossy but standard; the plain TCP based transport, which loses messages only during certain situations but is widely available; and the RELP transport, which does not lose messages but is currently available only as part of the rsyslogd 3.15.0 and above.
Examples of each configuration:
UDP               <xhtml:em>.</xhtml:em>
 @remotesystemname
TCP               <xhtml:em>.</xhtml:em>

RELP               <xhtml:em>.</xhtml:em>
 :omrelp:remotesystemname:2514

         <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
            <xhtml:p>
The Linux Auditing System operates on a set of rules that collects certain types of system activity to facilitate incident investigation, detect unauthorized access or modification of data.  By default events will be logged to           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log/audit/audit.log</xhtml:span>
, which can be configured in           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/audit/auditd.conf</xhtml:span>
.        </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>The following types of audit rules can be specified:</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>Control rules: Configuration of the auditing system.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>File system rules: Allow the auditing of access to a particular file or a directory. Also known as file watches.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>System call rules: Allow logging of system calls that any specified program makes.</xhtml:li>
            </xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:p>Audit rules can be set:</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>
On the command line using the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">auditctl</xhtml:span>
 utility. These rules are not persistent across reboots.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
In             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/audit/audit.rules</xhtml:span>
. These rules have to be merged and loaded before they are active.          </xhtml:li>
            </xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:strong>Note:</xhtml:strong>
            </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>
For 64 bit systems that have             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">arch</xhtml:span>
 as a rule parameter, you will need two rules: one for 64 bit and one for 32 bit systems calls. For 32 bit systems, only one rule is needed.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
If the auditing system is configured to be locked (            <xhtml:span class="inline_block">-e 2</xhtml:span>
), a system reboot will be required in order to load any changes.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>Key names are optional on the rules and will not be used in compliance auditing. The usage of key names is highly recommended as it facilitates organization and searching; as such, all remediation steps will have key names supplied.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
It is best practice to store the rules, in number prepended files, in             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/audit/rules.d/</xhtml:span>
. Rules must end in a             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">.rules</xhtml:span>
 suffix. This then requires the use of             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">augenrules</xhtml:span>
 to merge all the rules into             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/audit/audit.rules</xhtml:span>
 based on their alphabetical (lexical) sort order. All benchmark recommendations follow this best practice for remediation, specifically using the prefix of             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">50</xhtml:span>
 which is center weighed if all rule sets make use of the number prepending naming convention.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
Your system may have been customized to change the default             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">UID_MIN</xhtml:span>
. All sample output uses             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">1000</xhtml:span>
, but this value will not be used in compliance auditing. To confirm the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">UID_MIN</xhtml:span>
 for your system, run the following command:             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">awk '/^\s*UID_MIN/{print $2}' /etc/login.defs</xhtml:span>
               </xhtml:li>
            </xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:strong>Normalization</xhtml:strong>

The Audit system normalizes some entries, so when you look at the sample output keep in mind that:        </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>
With regards to users whose login UID is not set, the values             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">-1</xhtml:span>
 /             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">unset</xhtml:span>
 /             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">4294967295</xhtml:span>
 are equivalent and normalized to             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">-1</xhtml:span>
.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
When comparing field types and both sides of the comparison is valid fields types, such as             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">euid!=uid</xhtml:span>
, then the auditing system may normalize such that the output is             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">uid!=euid</xhtml:span>
.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>Some parts of the rule may be rearranged whilst others are dependent on previous syntax. For example, the following two statements are the same:</xhtml:li>
            </xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:code class="code_block">-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -C uid!=euid -F auid!=-1 -F key=user_emulation
</xhtml:code>
            <xhtml:p>and</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:code class="code_block">-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -C euid!=uid -F auid!=unset -S execve -k user_emulation
</xhtml:code>
            <xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:strong>Capacity planning</xhtml:strong>
            </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>The recommendations in this section implement auditing policies that not only produce large quantities of logged data, but may also negatively impact system performance. Capacity planning is critical in order not to adversely impact production environments.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>Disk space. If a significantly large set of events are captured, additional on system or off system storage may need to be allocated. If the logs are not sent to a remote log server, ensure that log rotation is implemented else the disk will fill up and the system will halt. Even when logs are sent to a log server, ensure sufficient disk space to allow caching of logs in the case of temporary network outages.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>Disk IO. It is not just the amount of data collected that should be considered, but the rate at which logs are generated.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>CPU overhead. System call rules might incur considerable CPU overhead. Test the systems open/close syscalls per second with and without the rules to gauge the impact of the rules.</xhtml:li>
            </xhtml:ul>

               <xhtml:p>When auditing, it is important to carefully configure the storage requirements for audit logs. By default, auditd will max out the log files at 5MB and retain only 4 copies of them. Older versions will be deleted. It is possible on a system that the 20 MBs of audit logs may fill up the system causing loss of audit data. While the recommendations here provide guidance, check your site policy for audit storage requirements.</xhtml:p>

For performance (                <xhtml:span class="inline_block">man 7 audit.rules</xhtml:span>
) reasons it is preferable to have all the system calls on one line. However, your configuration may have them on one line each or some other combination. This is important to understand for both the auditing and remediation sections as the examples given are optimized for performance as per the man page.              </xhtml:p>

For performance (                <xhtml:span class="inline_block">man 7 audit.rules</xhtml:span>
) reasons it is preferable to have all the system calls on one line. However, your configuration may have them on one line each or some other combination. This is important to understand for both the auditing and remediation sections as the examples given are optimized for performance as per the man page.              </xhtml:p>

 file systems to the system. While tracking               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">mount</xhtml:span>
 commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">open</xhtml:span>
,               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">creat</xhtml:span>
 and               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">truncate</xhtml:span>
 system calls requiring write access to a file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track successful writes to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track data export to media is beyond the scope of this document.            </xhtml:p>

For performance (                <xhtml:span class="inline_block">man 7 audit.rules</xhtml:span>
) reasons it is preferable to have all the system calls on one line. However, your configuration may have them on one line each or some other combination.

This is important to understand for both the auditing and remediation sections as the examples given are optimized for performance as per the man page.              </xhtml:p>

The main difference between this program and its traditional equivalents (passwd, chfn, chsh) is that prompts are written to standard out to make it easy for a graphical user interface wrapper to interface to it as a child process.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>When a user logs on, the AUID is set to the UID of the account that is being authenticated. Daemons are not user sessions and have the loginuid set to "-1". The AUID representation is an unsigned 32-bit integer, which equals "4294967295". The audit system interprets "-1", "4294967295", and "unset" in the same way.</xhtml:p>

World writable files are the least secure. Data in world-writable files can be modified and compromised by any user on the system. World writable files may also indicate an incorrectly written script or program that could potentially be the cause of a larger compromise to the system's integrity.

The             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/passwd</xhtml:span>
 file also contains information like user ID's and group ID's that are used by many system programs. Therefore, the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/passwd</xhtml:span>
 file must remain world readable. In spite of encoding the password with a randomly-generated one-way hash function, an attacker could still break the system if they got access to the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/passwd</xhtml:span>
 file. This can be mitigated by using shadowed passwords, thus moving the passwords in the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/passwd</xhtml:span>
 file to             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/shadow</xhtml:span>
. The             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/shadow</xhtml:span>
 file is set so only root will be able to read and write. This helps mitigate the risk of an attacker gaining access to the encoded passwords with which to perform a dictionary attack.          </xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>The executable search path (typically the PATH environment variable) contains a list of directories for the shell to search to find executables. If this path includes the current working directory (other than the user's home directory), executables in these directories may be executed instead of system commands. This variable is formatted as a colon-separated list of directories. If there is an empty entry, such as a leading or trailing colon or two consecutive colons, this is interpreted as the current working directory. If deviations from the default system search path for the local interactive user are required, they must be documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO).</xhtml:p>
