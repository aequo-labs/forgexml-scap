      <xhtml:p>This document provides prescriptive guidance for establishing a secure configuration posture for SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 systems running on x86_64 platforms.</xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p>This guide was developed and tested against SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 sp6</xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p>
The guidance within broadly assumes that operations are being performed as the       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root</xhtml:span>
 user, and executed under the default Bash version for the applicable distribution. Operations performed using       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">sudo</xhtml:span>
 instead of the       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root</xhtml:span>
 user, or executed under another shell, may produce unexpected results, or fail to make the intended changes to the system. Non-root users may not be able to access certain areas of the system, especially after remediation has been performed. It is advisable to verify       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root</xhtml:span>
 users path integrity and the integrity of any programs being run prior to execution of commands and scripts included in this benchmark.    </xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p>
The default prompt for the       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root</xhtml:span>
 user is       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">#</xhtml:span>
, and as such all sample commands will have       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">#</xhtml:span>
 as an additional indication that it is to be executed as       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root</xhtml:span>

   <xccdf:notice id="terms-of-use" xml:lang="en">	BACKGROUND.
	The Center for Internet Security ("CIS") provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to Internet users worldwide.	Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally generic in nature.	The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and devices.	Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to specific user requirements.	The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick fix" for anyone's information security needs.
	NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS.
	CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of	the Products or the Recommendations.	CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is" and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind.	USER AGREEMENTS.
	By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We") agree and acknowledge that:
	1.	No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component can be made fully secure;
	2.	We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our own risk;
	3.	We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from 		CIS's negligence or failure to perform; 
	4.	We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the 			Recommendations to our particular circumstances and requirements;
	5.	Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below) has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify us of 		the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and
	6.	Neither CIS nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise) for 		any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or damage 		to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, 	business interruption, wasted management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties) arising out of or in any way 	Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such 	damages), including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, 	viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other harmful items.
	GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS.
	CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use:
	1.	Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and 	use each of the Products on a single computer;
	2.	Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided 		that all such copies are printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed Terms of Use in its entirety.
	RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTION.
	The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and by international treaties.	We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties.	CIS reserves all rights not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights."
	Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute, encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device, without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi) use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product.	We will not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed in this paragraph.
	We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers, directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates, licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim.	We further agree that all CIS Parties are third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use.	SPECIAL RULES.
	CIS has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship.	Those special rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are covered by the special rules.
	CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization, whether by manual or electronic means.	Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time.
	CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION; VENUE.
	We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.	If any of these Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
	BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN ALL RESPECTS.</xccdf:notice>

               <xhtml:p>Several uncommon filesystem types are supported under Linux. Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the system. If a filesystem type is not needed it should be disabled. Native Linux file systems are designed to ensure that built-in security controls function as expected. Non-native filesystems can lead to unexpected consequences to both the security and functionality of the system and should be used with caution. Many filesystems are created for niche use cases and are not maintained and supported as the operating systems are updated and patched. Users of non-native filesystems should ensure that there is attention and ongoing support for them, especially in light of frequent operating system changes.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Standard network connectivity and Internet access to cloud storage may make the use of non-standard filesystem formats to directly attach heterogeneous devices much less attractive.</xhtml:p>

 application packages of software are self-contained and work across a range of Linux distributions. This is unlike traditional Linux package management approaches, like APT or RPM, which require specifically adapted packages per Linux distribution on an application update and delay therefore application deployment from developers to their software's end-user. Snaps themselves have no dependency on any external store ("App store"), can be obtained from any source and can be therefore used for upstream software deployment.                  </xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>Directories that are used for system-wide functions can be further protected by placing them on separate partitions. This provides protection for resource exhaustion and enables the use of mounting options that are applicable to the directory's intended use. Users' data can be stored on separate partitions and have stricter mount options. A user partition is a filesystem that has been established for use by the users and does not contain software for system operations.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>The recommendations in this section are easier to perform during initial system installation. If the system is already installed, it is recommended that a full backup be performed before repartitioning the system.</xhtml:p>

 you are repartitioning a system that has already been installed (This may require the system to be in single-user mode):          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:ul>
                  <xhtml:li>
Mount the new partition to a temporary mountpoint e.g.               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">mount /dev/sda2 /mnt</xhtml:span>
                  </xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>
Copy data from the original partition to the new partition. e.g.               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">cp -a /var/tmp/* /mnt</xhtml:span>
                  </xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>
Verify that all data is present on the new partition. e.g.               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ls -la /mnt</xhtml:span>
                  </xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>
Unmount the new partition. e.g.               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umount /mnt</xhtml:span>
                  </xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>
Remove the data from the original directory that was in the old partition. e.g.               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rm -Rf /var/tmp/*</xhtml:span>
 Otherwise it will still consume space in the old partition that will be masked when the new filesystem is mounted.            </xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>
Mount the new partition to the desired mountpoint. e.g.               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">mount /dev/sda2 /var/tmp</xhtml:span>
                  </xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>
Update               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/fstab</xhtml:span>
 with the new mountpoint. e.g.               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/dev/sda2  /var/tmp  xfs   defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime 0 0</xhtml:span>

Since                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">tmpfs</xhtml:span>
 lives completely in the page cache and on swap, all                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">tmpfs</xhtml:span>
 pages will be shown as "Shmem" in                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/proc/meminfo</xhtml:span>
 and "Shared" in                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">free</xhtml:span>

By design files saved to                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>

                              <xhtml:p>
If files need to be persistent through a reboot, they should be saved to                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/tmp</xhtml:span>
 not                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>

Since the                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>
 directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">tmpfs</xhtml:span>
 or a separate partition.                    </xhtml:p>

Running out of                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>
 space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it, but in a configuration where                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>
 is not a separate file system it will essentially have the whole disk available, as the default installation only creates a single                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/</xhtml:span>
 partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>
 (as with                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">tmpfs</xhtml:span>
) will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily. Another alternative is to create a dedicated partition for                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>
 from a separate volume or disk. One of the downsides of a disk-based dedicated partition is that it will be slower than                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">tmpfs</xhtml:span>
 which is RAM-based.                    </xhtml:p>

 its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as the                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">noexec</xhtml:span>

When modifying                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/home</xhtml:span>
 it is advisable to bring the system to emergency mode (so auditd is not running), rename the existing directory, mount the new file system, and migrate the data over before returning to multi-user mode.                </xhtml:p>

The default installation only creates a single                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/</xhtml:span>
 partition. Since the                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/home</xhtml:span>
 directory contains user generated data, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/home</xhtml:span>
 and impact all local users.              </xhtml:p>

Configuring                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/home</xhtml:span>
 as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">noexec/nosuid/nodev</xhtml:span>
. These options limit an attacker's ability to create exploits on the system. In the case of                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/home</xhtml:span>
 options such as                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">usrquota/grpquota</xhtml:span>
 may be considered to limit the impact that users can have on each other with regards to disk resource exhaustion. Other options allow for specific behavior. See                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">man mount</xhtml:span>
 for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options.              </xhtml:p>

When modifying                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var</xhtml:span>
 it is advisable to bring the system to emergency mode (so auditd is not running), rename the existing directory, mount the new file system, and migrate the data over before returning to multi-user mode.                </xhtml:p>

                     <xhtml:p>
The reasoning for mounting                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var</xhtml:span>
 on a separate partition is as follows.              </xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>
The default installation only creates a single                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/</xhtml:span>
 partition. Since the                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var</xhtml:span>
 directory may contain world writable files and directories, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var</xhtml:span>
 and cause unintended behavior across the system as the disk is full. See                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">man auditd.conf</xhtml:span>
 for details.              </xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>
Configuring                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var</xhtml:span>
 as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">noexec/nosuid/nodev</xhtml:span>
. These options limit an attacker's ability to create exploits on the system. Other options allow for specific behavior. See                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">man mount</xhtml:span>
 for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options.              </xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>
An example of exploiting                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var</xhtml:span>
 may be an attacker establishing a hard-link to a system                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">setuid</xhtml:span>
 program and waiting for it to be updated. Once the program is updated, the hard-link can be broken and the attacker would have their own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw.              </xhtml:p>

When modifying                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log</xhtml:span>
 it is advisable to bring the system to emergency mode (so auditd is not running), rename the existing directory, mount the new file system, and migrate the data over before returning to multiuser mode.                </xhtml:p>

The default installation only creates a single                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/</xhtml:span>
 partition. Since the                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log</xhtml:span>

Configuring                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log</xhtml:span>
 as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">noexec/nosuid/nodev</xhtml:span>
. These options limit an attackers ability to create exploits on the system. Other options allow for specific behavior. See                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">man mount</xhtml:span>

When modifying                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log/audit</xhtml:span>
 it is advisable to bring the system to emergency mode (so auditd is not running), rename the existing directory, mount the new file system, and migrate the data over before returning to multi-user mode.                </xhtml:p>

The default installation only creates a single                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/</xhtml:span>
 partition. Since the                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log/audit</xhtml:span>
 directory contains the                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">audit.log</xhtml:span>
 file which can grow quite large, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log/audit</xhtml:span>
 and cause                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">auditd</xhtml:span>

Configuring                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log/audit</xhtml:span>
 as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">noexec/nosuid/nodev</xhtml:span>
. These options limit an attacker's ability to create exploits on the system. Other options allow for specific behavior. See                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">man mount</xhtml:span>

            <xhtml:p>Mandatory Access Control (MAC) provides an additional layer of access restrictions to processes on top of the base Discretionary Access Controls. By restricting how processes can access files and resources on a system the potential impact from vulnerabilities in the processes can be reduced.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:strong>Impact:</xhtml:strong>
 Mandatory Access Control limits the capabilities of applications and daemons on a system, while this can prevent unauthorized access the configuration of MAC can be complex and difficult to implement correctly preventing legitimate access from occurring.        </xhtml:p>

            <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
               <xhtml:p>AppArmor provides a Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system that greatly augments the default Discretionary Access Control (DAC) model. Under AppArmor MAC rules are applied by file paths instead of by security contexts as in other MAC systems. As such it does not require support in the filesystem and can be applied to network mounted filesystems for example. AppArmor security policies define what system resources applications can access and what privileges they can do so with. This automatically limits the damage that the software can do to files accessible by the calling user. The user does not need to take any action to gain this benefit. For an action to occur, both the traditional DAC permissions must be satisfied as well as the AppArmor MAC rules. The action will not be allowed if either one of these models does not permit the action. In this way, AppArmor rules can only make a system's permissions more restrictive and secure.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:span class="inline_block">DEFAULT</xhtml:span>
 - The default system-wide cryptographic policy level offers secure settings for current threat models. It allows the TLS 1.2 and 1.3 protocols, as well as the IKEv2 and SSH2 protocols. The RSA keys and Diffie-Hellman parameters are accepted if they are at least 2048 bits long.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:span class="inline_block">LEGACY</xhtml:span>
 - This policy is less secure due to an increased attack surface. In addition to the DEFAULT level algorithms and protocols, it includes support for the TLS 1.0 and 1.1 protocols. The algorithms DSA, 3DES, and RC4 are allowed, while RSA keys and Diffie-Hellman parameters are accepted if they are at least 1023 bits long.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:span class="inline_block">FUTURE</xhtml:span>
 - A stricter forward-looking security level intended for testing a possible future policy. This policy does not allow the use of SHA-1 in signature algorithms. It allows the TLS 1.2 and 1.3 protocols, as well as the IKEv2 and SSH2 protocols. The RSA keys and Diffie-Hellman parameters are accepted if they are at least 3072 bits long. If your system communicates on the public internet, you might face interoperability problems.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:span class="inline_block">FIPS</xhtml:span>
 - A policy level that conforms with the FIPS 140 requirements. The fips-mode-setup tool, which switches the system into FIPS mode, uses this policy internally. Switching to the FIPS policy does not guarantee compliance with the FIPS 140 standard. You also must re-generate all cryptographic keys after you set the system to FIPS mode. This is not possible in many scenarios.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:span class="inline_block">BSI</xhtml:span>
 - A security policy based on recommendations by the German government agency             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">BSI</xhtml:span>

 FIPS is required by local site policy:            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>
The system-wide cryptographic policies contain a policy level that enables cryptographic algorithms in accordance with the requirements by the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 140. The fips-mode-setup tool that enables or disables FIPS mode internally uses the FIPS systemwide cryptographic policy.
Switching the system to FIPS mode by using the FIPS system-wide cryptographic policy does not guarantee compliance with the FIPS 140 standard. Re-generating all cryptographic keys after setting the system to FIPS mode may not be possible. For example, in the case of an existing IdM realm with users' cryptographic keys you cannot re-generate all the keys. The fips-mode-setup tool uses the FIPS policy internally. But on top of what the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">update-crypto-policies</xhtml:span>

            <xhtml:p>Presenting a warning message prior to the normal user login may assist in the prosecution of trespassers on the computer system. Changing some of these login banners also has the side effect of hiding OS version information and other detailed system information from attackers attempting to target specific exploits at a system.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>
Guidelines published by the US Department of Defense require that warning messages include at least the name of the organization that owns the system, the fact that the system is subject to monitoring and that such monitoring is in compliance with local statutes, and that use of the system implies consent to such monitoring. It is important that the organization's legal counsel review the content of all messages before any system modifications are made, as these warning messages are inherently site-specific.

The actions in this section of the document provide guidance on some services which can be safely disabled and under which circumstances, greatly reducing the number of possible threats to the resulting system.

 on the server with a particular RPC program number. The             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rpcbind.service</xhtml:span>

               <xhtml:p>Portmapper is an RPC service, which always listens on tcp and udp 111, and is used to map other RPC services (such as nfs, nlockmgr, quotad, mountd, etc.) to their corresponding port number on the server. When a remote host makes an RPC call to that server, it first consults with portmap to determine where the RPC server is listening.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:span class="inline_block">systemd-timesyncd</xhtml:span>
 is a daemon that has been added for synchronizing the system clock across the network. It implements an SNTP client. In contrast to NTP implementations such as chrony or the NTP reference server this only implements a client side, and does not bother with the full NTP complexity, focusing only on querying time from one remote server and synchronizing the local clock to it. The daemon runs with minimal privileges, and has been hooked up with networkd to only operate when network connectivity is available. The daemon saves the current clock to disk every time a new NTP sync has been acquired, and uses this to possibly correct the system clock early at bootup, in order to accommodate for systems that lack an RTC such as the Raspberry Pi and embedded devices, and make sure that time monotonically progresses on these systems, even if it is not always correct. To make use of this daemon a new system user and group "systemd-timesync" needs to be created on installation of systemd.          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>The default configuration is set during compilation, so configuration is only needed when it is necessary to deviate from those defaults. Initially, the main configuration file in /etc/systemd/ contains commented out entries showing the defaults as a guide to the administrator. Local overrides can be created by editing this file or by creating drop-ins, as described below. Using drop-ins for local configuration is recommended over modifications to the main configuration file.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>
In addition to the "main" configuration file, drop-in configuration snippets are read from             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/usr/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/</xhtml:span>
,             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/usr/local/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/</xhtml:span>
, and             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/systemd/*.conf.d/</xhtml:span>
. Those drop-ins have higher precedence and override the main configuration file. Files in the *.conf.d/ configuration subdirectories are sorted by their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of in which of the subdirectories they reside. When multiple files specify the same option, for options which accept just a single value, the entry in the file sorted last takes precedence, and for options which accept a list of values, entries are collected as they occur in the sorted files.          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>When packages need to customize the configuration, they can install drop-ins under /usr/. Files in /etc/ are reserved for the local administrator, who may use this logic to override the configuration files installed by vendor packages. Drop-ins have to be used to override package drop-ins, since the main configuration file has lower precedence. It is recommended to prefix all filenames in those subdirectories with a two-digit number and a dash, to simplify the ordering of the files.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>To disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a symlink to /dev/null in the configuration directory in /etc/, with the same filename as the vendor configuration file.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>

 is the program used to install, deinstall, or list the tables used to drive the cron daemon. Each user can have their own crontab, and though files are created, they are not intended to be edited directly.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>
If the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/cron.allow</xhtml:span>
 file exists, then you must be listed (one user per line) therein in order to be allowed to use this command. If the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/cron.allow</xhtml:span>
 file does not exist but the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/cron.deny</xhtml:span>
 file does exist, then you must not be listed in the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/cron.deny</xhtml:span>
 file in order to use this command.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>If neither of these files exists, then depending on site-dependent configuration parameters, only the super user will be allowed to use this command, or all users will be able to use this command.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>
If both files exist then               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/cron.allow</xhtml:span>
 takes precedence. Which means that               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/cron.deny</xhtml:span>
 is not considered and your user must be listed in               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/cron.allow</xhtml:span>
 in order to be able to use the crontab.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Regardless of the existence of any of these files, the root administrative user is always allowed to setup a crontab.</xhtml:p>

The files               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/cron.allow</xhtml:span>
 and               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/cron.deny</xhtml:span>
, if they exist, must be either world-readable, or readable by group               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">crontab</xhtml:span>
. If they are not, then cron will deny access to all users until the permissions are fixed.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>
There is one file for each user's crontab. Users are not allowed to edit the file directly to ensure that only users allowed by the system to run periodic tasks can add them, and only syntactically correct crontabs will be written. This is enforced by having the directory writable only by the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">crontab</xhtml:span>
 group and configuring crontab command with the setgid bid set for that specific group.            </xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:ul>
                     <xhtml:li>
Even though a given user is not listed in                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">cron.allow</xhtml:span>
, cron jobs can still be run as that user              </xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
The files                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/cron.allow</xhtml:span>
 and                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/cron.deny</xhtml:span>

 allows fairly complex time specifications, extending the POSIX.2 standard. It accepts times of the form HH:MM to run a job at a specific time of day. (If that time is already past, the next day is assumed.) You may also specify midnight, noon, or teatime (4pm) and you can have a time-of-day suffixed with AM or PM for running in the morning or the evening. You can also say what day the job will be run, by giving a date in the form month-name day with an optional year, or giving a date of the form MMDD[CC]YY, MM/DD/[CC]YY,  DD.MM.[CC]YY or [CC]YY-MM-DD. The specification of a date must follow the specification of the time of day. You can also give times like now + count time-units, where the time-units can be minutes, hours, days, or weeks and you can tell at to run the job today by suffixing the time with today and to run the job tomorrow by suffixing the time with tomorrow.            </xhtml:p>

 files determine which user can submit commands for later execution via at or batch. The format of the files is a list of usernames, one on each line. Whitespace is not permitted. If the file               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/at.allow</xhtml:span>
 exists, only usernames mentioned in it are allowed to use at. If               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/at.allow</xhtml:span>

               <xhtml:p>The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a transport layer protocol used to support message oriented communication, with several streams of messages in one connection. It serves a similar function as TCP and UDP, incorporating features of both. It is message-oriented like UDP, and ensures reliable in-sequence transport of messages with congestion control like TCP.</xhtml:p>

 is a good way to deter attackers from sending your system bogus packets that cannot be responded to. One instance where this feature breaks down is if asymmetrical routing is employed. This would occur when using dynamic routing protocols (bgp, ospf, etc) on your system. If you are using asymmetrical routing on your system, you will not be able to enable this feature without breaking the routing.          </xhtml:p>

 disables the system from accepting source routed packets. Assume this system was capable of routing packets to Internet routable addresses on one interface and private addresses on another interface. Assume that the private addresses were not routable to the Internet routable addresses and vice versa. Under normal routing circumstances, an attacker from the Internet routable addresses could not use the system as a way to reach the private address systems. If, however, source routed packets were allowed, they could be used to gain access to the private address systems as the route could be specified, rather than rely on routing protocols that did not allow this routing.          </xhtml:p>

When             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">tcp_syncookies</xhtml:span>
 is set, the kernel will handle TCP SYN packets normally until the half-open connection queue is full, at which time, the SYN cookie functionality kicks in. SYN cookies work by not using the SYN queue at all. Instead, the kernel simply replies to the SYN with a SYN/ACK, but will include a specially crafted TCP sequence number that encodes the source and destination IP address and port number and the time the packet was sent. A legitimate connection would send the ACK packet of the three way handshake with the specially crafted sequence number. This allows the system to verify that it has received a valid response to a SYN cookie and allow the connection, even though there is no corresponding SYN in the queue.          </xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>A firewall zone defines the trust level for a connection, interface or source address binding. This is a one to many relation, which means that a connection, interface or source can only be part of one zone, but a zone can be used for many network connections, interfaces and sources.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>The default zone is the zone that is used for everything that is not explicitly bound/assigned to another zone.
If no zone assigned to a connection, interface or source, only the default zone is used.
The default zone is not always listed as being used for an interface or source as it will be used for it either way. This depends on the manager of the interfaces.
Connections handled by NetworkManager are listed as NetworkManager requests to add the zone binding for the interface used by the connection. Also interfaces under control of the network service are listed also because the service requests it.</xhtml:p>

Secure Shell (SSH) is a secure, encrypted replacement for common login services such as           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">telnet</xhtml:span>

, and           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rcp</xhtml:span>
. It is strongly recommended that sites abandon older clear-text login protocols and use SSH to prevent session hijacking and sniffing of sensitive data off the network.        </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>
The recommendations in this section only apply if the SSH daemon is installed on the system,           <xhtml:strong>if remote access is not required the SSH daemon can be removed and this section skipped</xhtml:strong>

 and             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Match</xhtml:span>
, may cause the audits in this section's recommendations to report incorrectly. It is recommended that these options only be used if they're needed and fully understood. If these options are configured in accordance with local site policy, they should be accounted for when following the recommendations in this section.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
The default             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Include</xhtml:span>
 location is the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d</xhtml:span>
 directory. This default has been accounted for in this section. If a file has an additional             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Include</xhtml:span>

The audits of the running configuration in this section are run in the context of the root user, the local host name, and the local host's IP address. If a             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Match</xhtml:span>

 To clarify, the two settings described below are only meant for idle connections from a protocol perspective and are not meant to check if the user is active or not. An idle user does not mean an idle connection. SSH does not and never had, intentionally, the capability to drop idle users. In SSH versions before             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">8.2p1</xhtml:span>
 there was a bug that caused these values to behave in such a manner that they were abused to disconnect idle users. This bug has been resolved in             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">8.2p1</xhtml:span>
 and thus it can no longer be abused disconnect idle users.          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>
The two options             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveInterval</xhtml:span>
 and             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveCountMax</xhtml:span>

                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveInterval</xhtml:span>
 Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd(8) will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client.              </xhtml:p>

 Sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without sshd(8) receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the session.  It is important to note that the use of client alive messages is very different from TCPKeepAlive. The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel and therefore will not be spoofable. The TCP keepalive option en‐abled by TCPKeepAlive is spoofable. The client alive mechanism is valuable when the client or server depend on knowing when a connection has become unresponsive.
The default value is 3. If ClientAliveInterval is set to 15, and ClientAliveCountMax is left at the default, unresponsive SSH clients will be disconnected after approximately 45 seconds. Setting a zero ClientAliveCountMax disables connection termination.              </xhtml:p>

In order to prevent resource exhaustion, appropriate values should be set for both             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveInterval</xhtml:span>
 and             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveCountMax</xhtml:span>
. Specifically, looking at the source code,             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveCountMax</xhtml:span>
 must be greater than zero in order to utilize the ability of SSH to drop idle connections. If connections are allowed to stay open indefinitely, this can potentially be used as a DDOS attack or simple resource exhaustion could occur over unreliable networks.          </xhtml:p>

Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) is a service that implements modular authentication modules on UNIX systems. PAM is implemented as a set of shared objects that are loaded and executed when a program needs to authenticate a user. Files for PAM are typically located in the           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/pam.d</xhtml:span>
 directory. PAM must be carefully configured to secure system authentication. While this section covers some of PAM, please consult other PAM resources to fully understand the configuration capabilities.        </xhtml:p>

 provides a way to configure the default settings for locking the user after multiple failed authentication attempts. This file is read by the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">pam_faillock</xhtml:span>

The file has a very simple name = value format with possible comments starting with # character. The whitespace at the beginning of line, end of line, and around the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">=</xhtml:span>

                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">&lt;dir=/path/to/tally-directory&gt;</xhtml:span>
 - The directory where the user files with the failure records are kept. The default is /var/run/faillock. Note: These files will disappear after reboot on systems configured with directory /var/run/faillock mounted on virtual memory.              </xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">audit</xhtml:span>

                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">silent</xhtml:span>
 - Don't print informative messages to the user. Please note that when this option is not used there will be difference in the authentication behavior for users which exist on the system and non-existing users.              </xhtml:li>

                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">local_users_only</xhtml:span>
 - Only track failed user authentications attempts for local users in /etc/passwd and ignore centralized (AD, IdM, LDAP, etc.) users. The faillock(8) command will also no longer track user failed authentication attempts. Enabling this option will prevent a double-lockout scenario where a user is locked out locally and in the centralized mechanism.              </xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">nodelay</xhtml:span>

                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">deny=&lt;n&gt;</xhtml:span>
 - Deny access if the number of consecutive authentication failures for this user during the recent interval exceeds                 <xhtml:em></xhtml:em>
. The default is 3.              </xhtml:li>

                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">fail_interval=n</xhtml:span>
 - The length of the interval during which the consecutive authentication failures must happen for the user account lock out is n seconds. The default is 900 (15 minutes).              </xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">unlock_time=n</xhtml:span>
 - The access will be re-enabled after n seconds after the lock out. The value 0 has the same meaning as value never - the access will not be re-enabled without resetting the faillock entries by the faillock(8) command. The default is 600 (10 minutes). Note that the default directory that pam_faillock uses is usually cleared on system boot so the access will be also re-enabled after system reboot. If that is undesirable a different tally directory must be set with the dir option. Also note that it is usually undesirable to permanently lock out users as they can become easily a target of denial of service attack unless the usernames are random and kept secret to potential attackers.              </xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">even_deny_root</xhtml:span>
 - Root account can become locked as well as regular accounts.              </xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root_unlock_time=n</xhtml:span>
 - This option implies even_deny_root option. Allow access after n seconds to root account after the account is locked. In case the option is not specified the value is the same as of the unlock_time option.              </xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">admin_group=name</xhtml:span>
 - If a group name is specified with this option, members of the group will be handled by this module the same as the root account (the options even_deny_root and root_unlock_time will apply to them. By default the option is not set.              </xhtml:li>

                  <xhtml:p>The window of opportunity for an attacker to leverage compromised credentials or successfully compromise credentials via an online brute force attack is limited by the age of the password. Therefore, reducing the maximum age of a password also reduces an attacker's window of opportunity.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>We recommend a yearly password change. This is primarily because for all their good intentions users will share credentials across accounts. Therefore, even if a breach is publicly identified, the user may not see this notification, or forget they have an account on that site. This could leave a shared credential vulnerable indefinitely. Having an organizational policy of a 1-year (annual) password expiration is a reasonable compromise to mitigate this with minimal user burden.</xhtml:p>

The user file-creation mode mask (              <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
) is used to determine the file permission for newly created directories and files. In Linux, the default permissions for any newly created directory is 0777 (              <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rwxrwxrwx</xhtml:span>
), and for any newly created file it is 0666 (              <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rw-rw-rw-</xhtml:span>
). The               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 modifies the default Linux permissions by restricting (masking) these permissions. The               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 are cleared in the resulting file mode.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>

 or                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask 027</xhtml:span>
.  If a four digit umask is used, the first digit is ignored. The remaining three digits effect the resulting permissions for user, group, and world/other respectively.              </xhtml:li>

.  The permissions listed are not masked by                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
. ie a                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 set by                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask u=rwx,g=rx,o=</xhtml:span>

.  This                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>

The user file-creation mode mask (              <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
) is used to determine the file permission for newly created directories and files. In Linux, the default permissions for any newly created directory is 0777 (              <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rwxrwxrwx</xhtml:span>
), and for any newly created file it is 0666 (              <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rw-rw-rw-</xhtml:span>
). The               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 modifies the default Linux permissions by restricting (masking) these permissions. The               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 are cleared in the resulting file mode.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>

 or                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask 027</xhtml:span>
.  If a four digit umask is used, the first digit is ignored. The remaining three digits effect the resulting permissions for user, group, and world/other respectively.              </xhtml:li>

                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask 027</xhtml:span>
.  This                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 would set a newly created directory with file mode                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">drwxr-x---</xhtml:span>

      <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
         <xhtml:p>The items in this section describe how to configure logging, log monitoring, and auditing, using tools included in most distributions.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>
It is recommended that         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rsyslog </xhtml:span>
be used for logging (with         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">logwatch </xhtml:span>
providing summarization) and         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">auditd</xhtml:span>
 be used for auditing (with         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">aureport </xhtml:span>
providing summarization) to automatically monitor logs for intrusion attempts and other suspicious system behavior.      </xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>In addition to the local log files created by the steps in this section, it is also recommended that sites collect copies of their system logs on a secure, centralized log server via an encrypted connection. Not only does centralized logging help sites correlate events that may be occurring on multiple systems, but having a second copy of the system log information may be critical after a system compromise where the attacker has modified the local log files on the affected system(s). If a log correlation system is deployed, configure it to process the logs described in this section.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>
Because it is often necessary to correlate log information from many different systems (particularly after a security incident) it is recommended that the time be synchronized among systems and devices connected to the local network. The standard Internet protocol for time synchronization is the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which is supported by most network-ready devices. Reference &lt;        <xhtml:a href="http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/">http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/</xhtml:a>
&gt; manual page for more information on configuring chrony.      </xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>It is important that all logs described in this section be monitored on a regular basis and correlated to determine trends. A seemingly innocuous entry in one log could be more significant when compared to an entry in another log.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:strong>Note on log file permissions:</xhtml:strong>
 There really isn't a "one size fits all" solution to the permissions on log files. Many sites utilize group permissions so that administrators who are in a defined security group, such as "wheel" do not have to elevate privileges to root in order to read log files. Also, if a third party log aggregation tool is used, it may need to have group permissions to read the log files, which is preferable to having it run setuid to root. Therefore, there are two remediation and audit steps for log file permissions. One is for systems that do not have a secured group method implemented that only permits root to read the log files (        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root:root 600</xhtml:span>
). The other is for sites that do have such a setup and are designated as         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root:securegrp 640 </xhtml:span>
where         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">securegrp</xhtml:span>
 is the defined security group (in some cases         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">wheel</xhtml:span>
).      </xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rsyslog</xhtml:span>
               <xhtml:strong>- OR -</xhtml:strong>
               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">journald</xhtml:span>
. The recommendations are written such that each is wholly independent of each other and           <xhtml:strong>only one is implemented</xhtml:strong>

If your organization makes use of an enterprise wide logging system completely outside of             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rsyslog</xhtml:span>
 or             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">journald</xhtml:span>
, then the following recommendations do not directly apply. However, the principals of the recommendations should be followed regardless of what solution is implemented. If the enterprise solution incorporates either of these tools, careful consideration should be given to the following recommendations to determine exactly what applies.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
Should your organization make use of both             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rsyslog</xhtml:span>
 and             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">journald</xhtml:span>

            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>
Enterprise logging systems not utilizing             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rsyslog</xhtml:span>
 or             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">journald</xhtml:span>
. As logging is very situational and dependent on the local environment, not everything can be covered here.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
Transport layer security should be applied to all remote logging functionality. Both             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rsyslog</xhtml:span>
 and             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">journald</xhtml:span>
 supports secure transport and should be configured as such.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>The log server. There are a multitude of reasons for a centralized log server (and keeping a short period logging on the local system), but the log server is out of scope for these recommendations.</xhtml:li>

               <xhtml:p>
The             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rsyslog</xhtml:span>
 software package may be used instead of the default             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">journald</xhtml:span>
 logging mechanism.          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Rsyslog has evolved over several decades. For this reason it supports three different configuration formats (“languages”):</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:ul>
                  <xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">basic</xhtml:span>
 - previously known as the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">sysklogd</xhtml:span>
 format, this is the format best used to express basic things, such as where the statement fits on a single line.
              <xhtml:ul>
                        <xhtml:li>It stems back to the original syslog.conf format, in use now for several decades.</xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:li>The most common use case is matching on facility/severity and writing matching messages to a log file.</xhtml:li>
                     </xhtml:ul>
                  </xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">advanced</xhtml:span>
 - previously known as the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">RainerScript</xhtml:span>
 format, this format was first available in rsyslog v6 and is the current, best and most precise format for non-trivial use cases where more than one line is needed.
              <xhtml:ul>
                        <xhtml:li>Prior to v7, there was a performance impact when using this format that encouraged use of the basic format for best results. Current versions of rsyslog do not suffer from this (historical) performance impact.</xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:li>This new style format is specifically targeted towards more advanced use cases like forwarding to remote hosts that might be partially offline.</xhtml:li>
                     </xhtml:ul>
                  </xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">obsolete legacy</xhtml:span>
 - previously known simply as the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">legacy</xhtml:span>
 format, this format is exactly what its name implies: it is obsolete and should not be used when writing new configurations. It was created in the early days (up to rsyslog version 5) where we expected that rsyslog would extend sysklogd just mildly. Consequently, it was primarily aimed at small additions to the original sysklogd format.
              <xhtml:ul>
                        <xhtml:li>Practice has shown that it was notoriously hard to use for more advanced use cases, and thus we replaced it with the advanced format.</xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:li>In essence, everything that needs to be written on a single line that starts with a dollar sign is legacy format. Users of this format are encouraged to migrate to the basic or advanced formats.</xhtml:li>
                     </xhtml:ul>

, on the other hand, will record bootup events, but may delay sending the information to                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rsyslog</xhtml:span>

         <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
            <xhtml:p>
The Linux Auditing System operates on a set of rules that collects certain types of system activity to facilitate incident investigation, detect unauthorized access or modification of data.  By default events will be logged to           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log/audit/audit.log</xhtml:span>
, which can be configured in           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/audit/auditd.conf</xhtml:span>
.        </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>The following types of audit rules can be specified:</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>Control rules: Configuration of the auditing system.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>File system rules: Allow the auditing of access to a particular file or a directory. Also known as file watches.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>System call rules: Allow logging of system calls that any specified program makes.</xhtml:li>
            </xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:p>Audit rules can be set:</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>
On the command line using the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">auditctl</xhtml:span>
 utility. These rules are not persistent across reboots.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
In             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/audit/audit.rules</xhtml:span>
. These rules have to be merged and loaded before they are active.          </xhtml:li>
            </xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:strong>Notes:</xhtml:strong>
            </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>
For 64 bit systems that have             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">arch</xhtml:span>
 as a rule parameter, you will need two rules: one for 64 bit and one for 32 bit systems calls. For 32 bit systems, only one rule is needed.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
If the auditing system is configured to be locked (            <xhtml:span class="inline_block">-e 2</xhtml:span>
), a system reboot will be required in order to load any changes.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>Key names are optional on the rules and will not be used in compliance auditing. The usage of key names is highly recommended as it facilitates organization and searching; as such, all remediation steps will have key names supplied.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
It is best practice to store the rules, in number prepended files, in             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/audit/rules.d/</xhtml:span>
. Rules must end in a             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">.rules</xhtml:span>
 suffix. This then requires the use of             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">augenrules</xhtml:span>
 to merge all the rules into             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/audit/audit.rules</xhtml:span>
 based on their alphabetical (lexical) sort order. All benchmark recommendations follow this best practice for remediation, specifically using the prefix of             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">50</xhtml:span>
 which is center weighed if all rule sets make use of the number prepending naming convention.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
Your system may have been customized to change the default             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">UID_MIN</xhtml:span>
. All sample output uses             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">1000</xhtml:span>
, but this value will not be used in compliance auditing. To confirm the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">UID_MIN</xhtml:span>
 for your system, run the following command:             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">awk '/^\s*UID_MIN/{print $2}' /etc/login.defs</xhtml:span>
               </xhtml:li>
            </xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:strong>Normalization</xhtml:strong>

The Audit system normalizes some entries, so when you look at the sample output keep in mind that:        </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>
With regards to users whose login UID is not set, the values             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">-1</xhtml:span>
 /             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">unset</xhtml:span>
 /             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">4294967295</xhtml:span>
 are equivalent and normalized to             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">-1</xhtml:span>
.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
When comparing field types and both sides of the comparison is valid fields types, such as             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">euid!=uid</xhtml:span>
, then the auditing system may normalize such that the output is             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">uid!=euid</xhtml:span>
.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>Some parts of the rule may be rearranged whilst others are dependent on previous syntax. For example, the following two statements are the same:</xhtml:li>
            </xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:code class="code_block">-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -C uid!=euid -F auid!=-1 -F key=user_emulation
</xhtml:code>
            <xhtml:p>and</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:code class="code_block">-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -C euid!=uid -F auid!=unset -S execve -k user_emulation
</xhtml:code>
            <xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:strong>Capacity planning</xhtml:strong>
            </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>The recommendations in this section implement auditing policies that not only produce large quantities of logged data, but may also negatively impact system performance. Capacity planning is critical in order not to adversely impact production environments.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>Disk space. If a significantly large set of events are captured, additional on system or off system storage may need to be allocated. If the logs are not sent to a remote log server, ensure that log rotation is implemented else the disk will fill up and the system will halt. Even when logs are sent to a log server, ensure sufficient disk space to allow caching of logs in the case of temporary network outages.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>Disk IO. It is not just the amount of data collected that should be considered, but the rate at which logs are generated.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>CPU overhead. System call rules might incur considerable CPU overhead. Test the systems open/close syscalls per second with and without the rules to gauge the impact of the rules.</xhtml:li>
            </xhtml:ul>

For performance (                <xhtml:span class="inline_block">man 7 audit.rules</xhtml:span>
) reasons it is preferable to have all the system calls on one line. However, your configuration may have them on one line each or some other combination. This is important to understand for both the auditing and remediation sections as the examples given are optimized for performance as per the man page.              </xhtml:p>

For performance (                <xhtml:span class="inline_block">man 7 audit.rules</xhtml:span>
) reasons it is preferable to have all the system calls on one line. However, your configuration may have them on one line each or some other combination. This is important to understand for both the auditing and remediation sections as the examples given are optimized for performance as per the man page.              </xhtml:p>

For performance (                <xhtml:span class="inline_block">man 7 audit.rules</xhtml:span>
) reasons it is preferable to have all the system calls on one line. However, your configuration may have them on one line each or some other combination. This is important to understand for both the auditing and remediation sections as the examples given are optimized for performance as per the man page.              </xhtml:p>

It is highly unusual for a non privileged user to               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">mount</xhtml:span>
 file systems to the system. While tracking               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">mount</xhtml:span>
 commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">open</xhtml:span>
,               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">creat</xhtml:span>
 and               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">truncate</xhtml:span>
 system calls requiring write access to a file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track successful writes to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track data export to media is beyond the scope of this document.            </xhtml:p>

For performance (                <xhtml:span class="inline_block">man 7 audit.rules</xhtml:span>
) reasons it is preferable to have all the system calls on one line. However, your configuration may have them on one line each or some other combination. This is important to understand for both the auditing and remediation sections as the examples given are optimized for performance as per the man page.              </xhtml:p>

The             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/passwd</xhtml:span>
 file also contains information like user ID's and group ID's that are used by many system programs. Therefore, the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/passwd</xhtml:span>
 file must remain world readable. In spite of encoding the password with a randomly-generated one-way hash function, an attacker could still break the system if they got access to the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/passwd</xhtml:span>
 file. This can be mitigated by using shadowed passwords, thus moving the passwords in the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/passwd</xhtml:span>
 file to             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/shadow</xhtml:span>
. The             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/shadow</xhtml:span>
 file is set so only root will be able to read and write. This helps mitigate the risk of an attacker gaining access to the encoded passwords with which to perform a dictionary attack.          </xhtml:p>
