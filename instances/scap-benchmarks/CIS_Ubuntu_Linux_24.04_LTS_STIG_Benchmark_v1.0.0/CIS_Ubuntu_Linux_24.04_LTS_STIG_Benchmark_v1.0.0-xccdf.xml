   <xccdf:notice id="terms-of-use" xml:lang="en">	BACKGROUND.
	The Center for Internet Security ("CIS") provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to Internet users worldwide.	Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally generic in nature.	The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and devices.	Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to specific user requirements.	The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick fix" for anyone's information security needs.
	NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS.
	CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of	the Products or the Recommendations.	CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is" and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind.	USER AGREEMENTS.
	By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We") agree and acknowledge that:
	1.	No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component can be made fully secure;
	2.	We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our own risk;
	3.	We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from 		CIS's negligence or failure to perform; 
	4.	We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the 			Recommendations to our particular circumstances and requirements;
	5.	Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below) has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify us of 		the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and
	6.	Neither CIS nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise) for 		any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or damage 		to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, 	business interruption, wasted management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties) arising out of or in any way 	Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such 	damages), including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, 	viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other harmful items.
	GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS.
	CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use:
	1.	Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and 	use each of the Products on a single computer;
	2.	Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided 		that all such copies are printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed Terms of Use in its entirety.
	RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTION.
	The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and by international treaties.	We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties.	CIS reserves all rights not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights."
	Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute, encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device, without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi) use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product.	We will not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed in this paragraph.
	We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers, directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates, licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim.	We further agree that all CIS Parties are third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use.	SPECIAL RULES.
	CIS has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship.	Those special rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are covered by the special rules.
	CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization, whether by manual or electronic means.	Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time.
	CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION; VENUE.
	We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.	If any of these Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
	BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN ALL RESPECTS.</xccdf:notice>

            <xhtml:p>Protecting the integrity of the tools used for auditing purposes is a critical step toward ensuring the integrity of audit information.

            <xhtml:p>Audit tools include, but are not limited to, vendor-provided and open source audit tools needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information system activity and records. Audit tools include custom queries and report generators.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>Without cryptographic integrity protections, information can be altered by unauthorized users without detection.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Remote access (e.g., RDP) is access to DOD nonpublic information systems by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external, nonorganization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities conducted by individuals communicating through a network, either an external network (e.g., the internet) or an internal network.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Local maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities carried out by individuals physically present at the information system or information system component and not communicating across a network connection.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Encrypting information for transmission protects information from unauthorized disclosure and modification. Cryptographic mechanisms implemented to protect information integrity include, for example, cryptographic hash functions that have common application in digital signatures, checksums, and message authentication codes.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been issued certificates by DOD-approved PKIs, all DOD systems (e.g., web servers and web portals) must be properly configured to incorporate access control methods that do not rely solely on the possession of a certificate for access.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Access control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. These policies and mechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>Automatic session termination addresses the termination of user-initiated logical sessions in contrast to the termination of network connections associated with communications sessions (i.e., network disconnect). A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an organizational information system. Such user sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate user access) without terminating network sessions.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>Temporary accounts are privileged or nonprivileged accounts established during pressing circumstances, such as new software or hardware configuration or an incident response, where the need for prompt account activation requires bypassing normal account authorization procedures. If any inactive temporary accounts are left enabled on the system and are not either manually removed or automatically expired within 72 hours, the security posture of the system will be degraded and exposed to exploitation by unauthorized users or insider threat actors.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Temporary accounts are different from emergency accounts. Emergency accounts, also known as "last resort" or "break glass" accounts, are local logon accounts enabled on the system for emergency use by authorized system administrators to manage a system when standard logon methods are failing or not available. Emergency accounts are not subject to manual removal or scheduled expiration requirements.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>The automatic expiration of temporary accounts may be extended as needed by the circumstances, but it must not be extended indefinitely. A documented permanent account should be established for privileged users who need long-term maintenance accounts.</xhtml:p>

-At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS.              <br></br>
                     <br></br>
-Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used for any USG-authorized purpose.              <br></br>
                     <br></br>
-This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls) to protect USG interests--not for your personal benefit or privacy.              <br></br>

            <xhtml:p>The security risk of using X11 forwarding is that the client's X11 display server may be exposed to attack when the SSH client requests forwarding.  A system administrator may have a stance in which they want to protect clients that may expose themselves to attack by unwittingly requesting X11 forwarding, which can warrant a ''no'' setting.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>X11 forwarding should be enabled with caution. Users with the ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host (for the user's X11 authorization database) can access the local X11 display through the forwarded connection. An attacker may then be able to perform activities such as keystroke monitoring if the ForwardX11Trusted option is also enabled.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>To ensure individual accountability and prevent unauthorized access, organizational users must be individually identified and authenticated.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>A group authenticator is a generic account used by multiple individuals. Use of a group authenticator alone does not uniquely identify individual users. Examples of the group authenticator is the Unix OS "root" user account, the Windows "Administrator" account, the "sa" account, or a "helpdesk" account.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>For example, the Unix and Windows operating systems offer a "switch user" capability allowing users to authenticate with their individual credentials and, when needed, "switch" to the administrator role. This method provides for unique individual authentication prior to using a group authenticator.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Users (and any processes acting on behalf of users) must be uniquely identified and authenticated for all accesses other than those accesses explicitly identified and documented by the organization, which outlines specific user actions that can be performed on the operating system without identification or authentication.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Requiring individuals to be authenticated with an individual authenticator prior to using a group authenticator allows for traceability of actions, as well as adding an additional level of protection of the actions that can be taken with group account knowledge.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>When there is a chain of trust, usually the top entity to be trusted becomes the trust anchor; it can be, for example, a certification authority (CA).

            <xhtml:p>This requirement verifies that a certification path to an accepted trust anchor is used for certificate validation and that the path includes status information. Path validation is necessary for a relying party to make an informed trust decision when presented with any certificate not already explicitly trusted.

            <xhtml:p>Automatic session termination addresses the termination of user-initiated logical sessions in contrast to the termination of network connections that are associated with communications sessions (i.e., network disconnect). A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an organizational information system. Such user sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate user access) without terminating network sessions.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>An isolation boundary provides access control and protects the integrity of the hardware, software, and firmware that perform security functions.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Security functions are the hardware, software, and/or firmware of the information system responsible for enforcing the system security policy and supporting the isolation of code and data on which the protection is based. Operating systems implement code separation (i.e., separation of security functions from nonsecurity functions) in a number of ways, including through the provision of security kernels via processor rings or processor modes. For nonkernel code, security function isolation is often achieved through file system protections that serve to protect the code on disk and address space protections that protect executing code.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Developers and implementers can increase the assurance in security functions by employing well-defined security policy models; structured, disciplined, and rigorous hardware and software development techniques; and sound system/security engineering principles. Implementation may include isolation of memory space and libraries.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>The operating system restricts access to security functions through the use of access control mechanisms and by implementing least privilege capabilities.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>Preventing unauthorized information transfers mitigates the risk of information, including encrypted representations of information, produced by the actions of prior users/roles (or the actions of processes acting on behalf of prior users/roles) from being available to any current users/roles (or current processes) that obtain access to shared system resources (e.g., registers, main memory, hard disks) after those resources have been released back to information systems. The control of information in shared resources is also commonly referred to as object reuse and residual information protection.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>This requirement generally applies to the design of an information technology product, but it can also apply to the configuration of particular information system components that are, or use, such products. This can be verified by acceptance/validation processes in DOD or other government agencies.</xhtml:p>

A variety of technologies exist to limit or, in some cases, eliminate the effects of DoS attacks (e.g., limiting processes or establishing memory partitions). Employing increased capacity and bandwidth, combined with service redundancy, may reduce the susceptibility to some DoS attacks.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>Without protection of communications with wireless peripherals, confidentiality and integrity may be compromised because unprotected communications can be intercepted and either read, altered, or used to compromise the operating system.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>This requirement applies to wireless peripheral technologies (e.g., wireless mice, keyboards, displays, etc.) used with an operating system. Wireless peripherals (e.g., Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/IR Keyboards, Mice, and Pointing Devices and Near Field Communications [NFC]) present a unique challenge by creating an open, unsecured port on a computer. Wireless peripherals must meet DOD requirements for wireless data transmission and be approved for use by the AO. Even though some wireless peripherals, such as mice and pointing devices, do not ordinarily carry information that need to be protected, modification of communications with these wireless peripherals may be used to compromise the operating system. Communication paths outside the physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of interception and modification.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of communications with wireless peripherals can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., employing physical barriers to wireless radio frequencies) or by logical means (e.g., employing cryptographic techniques). If physical means of protection are employed, then logical means (cryptography) do not have to be employed, and vice versa. If the wireless peripheral is only passing telemetry data, encryption of the data may not be required.</xhtml:p>
