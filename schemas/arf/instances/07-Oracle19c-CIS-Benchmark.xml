              <cdf12:notice id="terms-of-use" xml:lang="en">	BACKGROUND.
	The Center for Internet Security ("CIS") provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to Internet users worldwide.	Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally generic in nature.	The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and devices.	Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to specific user requirements.	The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick fix" for anyone's information security needs.
	NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS.
	CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of	the Products or the Recommendations.	CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is" and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind.	USER AGREEMENTS.
	By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We") agree and acknowledge that:
	1.	No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component can be made fully secure;
	2.	We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our own risk;
	3.	We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from 		CIS's negligence or failure to perform; 
	4.	We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the 			Recommendations to our particular circumstances and requirements;
	5.	Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below) has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify us of 		the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and
	6.	Neither CIS nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise) for 		any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or damage 		to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, 	business interruption, wasted management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties) arising out of or in any way 	Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such 	damages), including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, 	viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other harmful items.
	GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS.
	CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use:
	1.	Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and 	use each of the Products on a single computer;
	2.	Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided 		that all such copies are printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed Terms of Use in its entirety.
	RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTION.
	The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and by international treaties.	We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties.	CIS reserves all rights not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights."
	Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute, encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device, without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi) use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product.	We will not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed in this paragraph.
	We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers, directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates, licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim.	We further agree that all CIS Parties are third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use.	SPECIAL RULES.
	CIS has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship.	Those special rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are covered by the special rules.
	CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization, whether by manual or electronic means.	Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time.
	CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION; VENUE.
	We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.	If any of these Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
	BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN ALL RESPECTS.</cdf12:notice>&#xd;

The restrictions on Client/User connections to the Oracle database help block unauthorized access to data and services by setting access rules. These security measures help to ensure that successful logins cannot be easily made through brute-force password attacks or intuited by clever social engineering exploits. Settings are generally recommended to be applied to all defined profiles rather than by using only the         &#xd;

Decisions must be made regarding the scope of auditing since auditing has costs - in storage for the audit trail and in performance impact on audited operations - and perhaps even the database or system in general. There is also the additional cost to manage (store, backup, secure) and review the data in the audit trail.</xhtml:p>

Any attempt to logon to a locked account, failed attempts to logon to default accounts or an unusually high number of failed logon attempts of any sort, for any user, in a particular time period may indicate an intrusion attempt. In forensics, the logon record may be first in a chain of evidence and contain information found in no other type of audit record for the session.
